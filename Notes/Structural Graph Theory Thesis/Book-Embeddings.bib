The theorem states that for every grid H, every graph whose treewidth is large enough relative to |V(H)| contains H as a minor. This theorem has found many applications in graph theory and algorithms. Let f(k) denote the largest value such that every graph of treewidth k contains a grid minor of size (f(k) × f(k)). The best previous quantitative bound, due to recent work of Kawarabayashi and Kobayashi, and Leaf and Seymour, shows that f(k)=Ω(√log k/log log k). In contrast, the best known upper bound implies that f(k) = O(√k/log k). In this article, we obtain the first polynomial relationship between treewidth and grid minor size by showing that f(k) = Ω(kδ) for some fixed constant δ \&gt; 0, and describe a randomized algorithm, whose running time is polynomial in |V(G)| and k, that with high probability finds a model of such a grid minor in G.},

  abstract = {We study the Excluded Grid Theorem, a fundamental structural result in graph theory, that was proved by Robertson and Seymour in their seminal work on graph minors. The theorem states that there is a function f:Z+→Z+, such that for every integer g{$>$}0, every graph of treewidth at least f(g) contains the (g×g)-grid as a minor. For every integer g{$>$}0, let f(g) be the smallest value for which the theorem holds. Establishing tight bounds on f(g) is an important graph-theoretic question. Robertson and Seymour showed that f(g)=Ω(g2log⁡g) must hold. For a long time, the best known upper bounds on f(g) were super-exponential in g. The first polynomial upper bound of f(g)=O(g98polylog⁡g) was proved by Chekuri and Chuzhoy. It was later improved to f(g)=O(g36polylog⁡g), and then to f(g)=O(g19polylog⁡g). In this paper we further improve this bound to f(g)=O(g9polylog⁡g). We believe that our proof is significantly simpler than the proofs of the previous bounds. Moreover, while there are natural barriers that seem to prevent previous methods from yielding tight bounds for the theorem, it seems conceivable that the techniques proposed in this paper can lead to even tighter bounds on f(g).},

The minimum number of colours, taken over all drawings of G, is the classical graph parameter thickness. By restricting the edges to be straight, we obtain the geometric thickness. By additionally restricting the vertices to be in convex position, we obtain the book thickness. This paper studies the relationship between these parameters and treewidth. Our first main result states that for graphs of treewidth k, the maximum thickness and the maximum geometric thickness both equal ⌈k/2⌉. This says that the lower bound for thickness can be matched by an upper bound, even in the more restrictive geometric setting. Our second main result states that for graphs of treewidth k, the maximum book thickness equals k if k ≤ 2 and equals k + 1 if k ≥ 3. This refutes a conjecture of Ganley and Heath [Discrete Appl. Math. 109(3):215-221, 2001]. Analogous results are proved for outerthickness, arboricity, and star-arboricity.},

It is known that every graph has a 3-stack subdivision. The best known upper bound on the number of division vertices per edge in a 3-stack subdivision of an n-vertex graph G is improved from O(log n) to O(log min\textbackslash sn(G),qn(G)\textbackslash ). This result reduces the question of whether queue-number is bounded by stack-number to whether 3-stack graphs have bounded queue number.\textbackslash par It is proved that every graph has a 2-queue subdivision, a 4-track subdivision, and a mixed 1-stack 1-queue subdivision. All these values are optimal for every non-planar graph. In addition, we characterise those graphs with k-stack, k-queue, and k-track subdivisions, for all values of k. The number of division vertices per edge in the case of 2-queue and 4-track subdivisions, namely O(log qn(G)), is optimal to within a constant factor, for every graph G. \textbackslash par Applications to 3D polyline grid drawings are presented.

  abstract = {In graph theory, a book embedding is a generalization of planar embedding of a graph to embeddings in a book, a collection of half-planes all having the same line as their boundary. Usually, the vertices of the graph are required to lie on this boundary line, called the spine, and the edges are required to stay within a single half-plane. The book thickness of a graph is the smallest possible number of half-planes for any book embedding of the graph. Book thickness is also called pagenumber, stacknumber or fixed outerthickness. Book embeddings have also been used to define several other graph invariants including the pagewidth and book crossing number. Every graph with n vertices has book thickness at most                         ⌈         n                    /                  2         ⌉                 \{\textbackslash displaystyle \textbackslash lceil n/2\textbackslash rceil \}    , and this formula gives the exact book thickness for complete graphs. The graphs with book thickness one are the outerplanar graphs. The graphs with book thickness at most two are the subhamiltonian graphs, which are always planar; more generally, every planar graph has book thickness at most four. All minor-closed graph families, and in particular the graphs with bounded treewidth or bounded genus, also have bounded book thickness. It is NP-hard to determine the exact book thickness of a given graph, with or without knowing a fixed vertex ordering along the spine of the book. Testing the existence of a three-page book embedding of a graph, given a fixed ordering of the vertices along the spine of the embedding, has unknown computational complexity: it is neither known to be solvable in polynomial time nor known to be NP-hard. One of the original motivations for studying book embeddings involved applications in VLSI design, in which the vertices of a book embedding represent components of a circuit and the wires represent connections between them. Book embedding also has applications in graph drawing, where two of the standard visualization styles for graphs, arc diagrams and circular layouts, can be constructed using book embeddings. In transportation planning, the different sources and destinations of foot and vehicle traffic that meet and interact at a traffic light can be modeled mathematically as the vertices of a graph, with edges connecting different source-destination pairs. A book embedding of this graph can be used to design a schedule that lets all the traffic move across the intersection with as few signal phases as possible. In bioinformatics problems involving the folding structure of RNA, single-page book embeddings represent classical forms of nucleic acid secondary structure, and two-page book embeddings represent pseudoknots. Other applications of book embeddings include  abstract algebra and knot theory.},

A book embedding of a graph maps the vertices onto a line along the spine of the book and assigns the edges to pages of the book such that no two edges on the same page cross. The pagenumber of a graph is the minimum number of pages in a valid book embedding. In this paper, it is proven that the pagenumber of a k-tree is at most k+1. Furthermore, it is shown that there exist k-trees that require k pages.

Many important RNA molecules, however, contain pseudo-knots, a structural feature that is excluded explicitly from the conventional definition of secondary structures. We propose here a generalization of secondary structures incorporating ‘non-nested’ pseudo-knots, which we call bi-secondary structures, and discuss measures for the complexity of more general contact structures based on their graph-theoretical properties. Bi-secondary structures are planar trivalent graphs that are characterized by special embedding properties. We derive exact upper bounds on their number (as a function of the chain length n) implying that there are fewer different structures than sequences. Computational results show that the number of bi-secondary structures grows approximately like 2.35n. Numerical studies based on kinetic folding and a simple extension of the standard energy model show that the global features of the sequence-structure map of RNA do not change when pseudo-knots are introduced into the secondary structure picture. We find a large fraction of neutral mutations and, in particular, networks of sequences that fold into the same shape. These neutral networks percolate through the entire sequence space.},

In this paper, it is proven that genus g graphs can be embedded in O(g) pages, thus disproving the conjecture. An Ω(g1/2) lower bound is also derived. The first algorithm in the literature for embedding an arbitrary graph in a book with a non-trivial upper bound on the number of pages is presented. First, the algorithm computes the genus g of a graph using the algorithm of Filotti, Miller, Reif (1979), which is polynomial-time for fixed genus. Second, it applies an optimal-time algorithm for obtaining an O(g)-page book embedding. Separate book embedding algorithms are given for the cases of graphs embedded in orientable and nonorientable surfaces. An important aspect of the construction is a new decomposition theorem, of independent interest, for a graph embedded on a surface. Book embedding has application in several areas, two of which are directly related to the results obtained: fault-tolerant VLSI and complexity theory.},

We show that (generalized) genus is additive over edge (vertex) amalgams, i.e., if G is obtained from disjoint graph, H1 and H2 by identifying an edge (vertex) in H1 with an edge (vertex) in H2 then generalized genus of G equals the sum of the generalized genus of H1 plus the generalized genus of H2. We introduce a new combinatorial representation of an embedding which seems to lend itself to combinatorial arguments for embedding of graphs on unoriented surfaces.},

Although it is still exponential in the order of the graph, the algorithm presented here is relatively simple to describe and implement and fast-in-practice for small graphs.It parallels the popular quadratic planar embedding algorithm of Demoucron, Malgrange, and Pertuiset.},

Consequently, the 4CC implies Hadwiger's conjecture whent=5, because it implies that apex graphs are 5-colourable.},

  author = {Sanders, Daniel Preston},
  date = {1993},
  institution = {Georgia Institute of Technology},
  location = {USA},
  abstract = {A graph G has tree-width at most k if the vertices of G can be decomposed into a tree-like structure of sets of vertices, each set having cardinality at most \$k+1.\$ An alternate definition of tree-width is in terms of k-elimination sequences, an order to eliminate the vertices of the graph such that each vertex, at the time it is eliminated from the graph, has degree at most k. Amborg and Proskurowski have shown that if a graph has tree-width at most a fixed k, then many NP-hard problems can be solved in linear time, provided this k-elimination sequence is part of the input. Some examples are maximum independent set, minimum dominating set, chromatic number, Hamilton circuit, and network reliability. These algorithms are very efficient for small k, such as 2, 3, or 4, but may be impractical for large k, as they depend exponentially on k.This thesis presents a practical, efficient linear algorithm to find a 4-elimination sequence for a graph of tree-width at most four. Graphs of tree-width at most k are a natural generalization of series-parallel graphs. Just as linear algorithms on series-parallel graphs depend upon their structure, that they have an instance of a series-reduction or a parallel-reduction, the algorithm presented in this thesis depends upon the graphs having certain reductions as well. A reduction process is developed, and reductions are shown that can be applied to a graph of tree-width at most four without increasing its tree-width. Further, each graph of tree-width at most four is shown to contain one of these reductions. The reductions are then used in a linear time algorithm which generates a 4-elimination sequence, if one exists.},

Every graph with path-width at least \$w-1\$ contains every \$w\$-vertex forest as a minor: this was originally proved by Bienstock, Robertson, Thomas and the author, and was given a short proof by Diestel. Here we give a proof even shorter and simpler than that of Diestel.},

  abstract = {A book embedding of a graph consists of a linear ordering of the vertices along a line in 3-space (the spine), and an assignment of edges to half-planes with the spine as boundary (the pages), so that edges assigned to the same page can be drawn on that page without crossings. Given a graph G = (V,E), let f : V → ℕ be a function such that 1 ≤ f(υ) ≤ deg(υ). We present a Las Vegas algorithm which produces a book embedding of G with \$\$O(\textbackslash sqrt \{|E| \textbackslash cdot \textbackslash max \_\textbackslash upsilon  \textbackslash left\textbackslash lceil \{\textbackslash deg (\textbackslash upsilon )/f(\textbackslash upsilon )\} \textbackslash right\textbackslash rceil \} )\$\$pages, such that at most f(v) edges incident to a vertex v are on a single page. This algorithm generalises existing results for book embeddings. We apply this algorithm to produce 3-D orthogonal drawings with one bend per edge and O(∣V ∣3/2∣E∣) volume, and single-row drawings with two bends per edge and the same volume. In the produced drawings each edge is entirely contained in some Z-plane; such drawings are without so-called cross-cuts, and are particularly appropriate for applications in multilayer VLSI. Using a different approach, we achieve two bends per edge with O(∣V ∣∣E∣) volume but with cross-cuts. These results establish improved bounds for the volume of 3-D orthogonal graph drawings.},

This result was generalized by Škrekovski (Discrete Math., 190 (1998), pp. 223–226) and He, Miao, and Shen (Discrete Math., 308 (2008), pp. 4024–4026), who proved that every \$K\_5\$-minor-free graph is 5-choosable. Both proofs rely on the characterization of \$K\_5\$-minor-free graphs due to Wagner (Math. Ann., 114 (1937), pp. 570–590). This paper proves the same result without using Wagner's structure theorem or even planar embeddings. Given that there is no structure theorem for graphs with no \$K\_6\$-minor, we argue that this proof suggests a possible approach for attacking the Hadwiger Conjecture.}
