\chapter{Planar graphs and vortices}\label{chap:planar}

This chapter explores book-embeddings of planar graphs on orientable surfaces. 
We discuss an embedding of a graph $G$ with a bounded number of pages, using \cref{thm:Planar Graph Hickingbotham Bound}. We then discuss some strategies to embed a vortex on a planar graph, using \cref{thm:Planar Graph Hickingbotham Bound}. The main strategy we discuss are \textit{monochromatic paths}, and prove some results on graphs with book-embeddings that bound the number of monochromatic paths. We assumed that every planar graph has a book-embedding where every face has a bounded number of monochromatic paths, but this assumption is false.
