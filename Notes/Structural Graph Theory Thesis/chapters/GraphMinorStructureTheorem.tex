\chapter{Graph Minors}\label{chap:gmst}
This chapter discusses graph minors and some parameters which bound the size of the largest clique minor in a graph. The parameters that are discussed are treewidth, pathwidth, planar graphs, and graphs on surfaces. 
The Graph Minor Structure Theorem, proven by \textcite{robertsonGraphMinorsXVI2003} is an important characterisation of $K_t$-minor-free graphs. The Graph Minor Structure Theorem was developed to solve the Graph Minor Theorem, also by \textcite{robertsonGraphMinorsXX2004}. Many problems of the form: ``Every $K_t$-minor-free graph has some bounded parameter, with the bound being $f(t)$'' uses some version of the Graph Minor Structure Theorem in its proof. 
Each component of the graph minor structure theorem is gone through in detail. This chapter then discusses the Graph Minor Theorem, which is what the Graph Minor Structure Theorem was designed to prove.
