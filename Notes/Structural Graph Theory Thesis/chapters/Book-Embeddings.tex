\chapter{Book-Embeddings and treewidth}\label{chap:book-embeddings}

This chapter explores book-embeddings in more detail and discusses two papers connecting a tree-decomposition of a graph to a book-embedding of a graph. The first paper reviewed is by \textcite{ganleyPagenumberTrees2001} and the second is an unpublished paper by \textcite{hickingbothamStackNumberCliqueSum2023}.
