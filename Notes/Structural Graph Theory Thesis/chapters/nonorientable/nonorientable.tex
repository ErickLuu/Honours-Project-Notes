\section{Further developments}

\textcite{heathPagenumberGenusGraphs1992} did not adequately prove that graphs embedded on non-orientable surfaces of genus $g$ can be bounded on $k$ pages where $k = k(g)$. For the case when the surface is of genus $1$, \textcite{nakamotoBookEmbeddingProjectiveplanar2015} showed that every projective-planar graph can be embedded in $9$ pages, which was improved to 6 by \textcite{ozekiBookEmbeddingGraphs2019}. However, we want to find a book-embedding for all non-orientable surfaces. 

\textcite{ozekiBookEmbeddingGraphs2019} states that they were unable to prove that all Klein bottle graphs can be embedded on a bounded number of pages. \cref{sec:kleinbottle} discusses some strategies to embed Klein bottle graphs, but the problem remains open. The Klein bottle case is just one example in the much broader class of non-orientable surfaces, which is stated in \cref{conj:nonorientable}. For the case that the surface is a projective plane, then $G$ can be embedded in 6 pages, from \textcite{ozekiBookEmbeddingGraphs2019}. We believe the easiest conjecture currently to prove (or possibly disprove) is \cref{conj:nonorientable}. 
\begin{conjecture}\label{conj:nonorientable}
	Every non-orientable genus $g$ graph can be embedded in $f(g)$ pages for some function $f$. 
\end{conjecture}
