\section{Results}
We discuss some results of \cref{conj:bded_had_pn}.

%\cref{conj:bded_had_pn} also implies a weakening of Hadwiger's conjecture, \cref{conj:Hadwiger's Conjecture}.  If a graph $G$ is $K_t$ minor free, then from \cref{conj:bded_had_pn}, $G$ can be embedded on $f(t)$ pages. But from \cref{thm:Colouring_Bound}, this implies that $G$ can be coloured with $2f(t) + 2$ colours.
