The \textit{treewidth} of a graph \(G\) measures how similar $G$ is to a forest.
\begin{definition}[Tree-decomposition]\label{def:tree-decomposition}
	A tree-decomposition \(\tree\) of a graph \(G\) is defined as a tree \(T\) with associated \textit{bags} \(\lbrace B_x : x \in V(T) \rbrace\) such that:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $\bigcup_{x \in V(T)} B_x = V(G)$.
		\item For all \(v \in V(G)\), the subset of vertices \(\left\lbrace x \in V(T): v \in B_x \right\rbrace\) induces a connected subtree in \(V(T)\).
		\item For all edges \(vw \in E(G)\), there exists a bag \(B_x\) such that both \(v\) and \(w\) are in \(B_x\).
	\end{itemize}
\end{definition}
The vertices of the tree \(T\) are \textit{nodes}, to distinguish them from the vertices of $G$. 
The \textit{width} of the tree decomposition \(\tree\) is defined as \(\max \lbrace |B_x| - 1 : x \in V(T) \rbrace\).
The treewidth of a graph \(G\), denoted as \(\tw(G)\), is defined to be the smallest width for all tree-decompositions of the graph \(G\). 

Treewidth was introduced by \textcite{berteleChapterEliminationVariables1972} with applications to dynamic programming under the name ``dimension''. Treewidth was then rediscovered by \textcite{halinSfunctionsGraphs1976}, under the name of ``S-function''. Neither of the papers above introduced the notion of a tree-decomposition.

\textcite{robertsonGraphMinorsIII1984} introduced treewidth as defined in \cref{def:tree-decomposition}. They introduced treewidth in the context of a tree-decomposition. This definition is concrete and could be calculated explicitly for any graph. They showed that if $\mathcal{F}$ is a graph family with bounded treewidth, then there exists a planar graph $H$ such that $H$ is a forbidden minor of $\mathcal{F}$. This was used to prove the Graph Minor Theorem. Furthermore, \textcite{robertsonQuicklyExcludingPlanar1994} refined this theorem. They showed that if a graph $G$ has treewidth $k$ if and only if $G$ contains a grid minor of size $f(k) \times f(k)$. This is the Grid Minor Theorem. \textcite{chekuriPolynomialBoundsGridMinor2016} showed that $f \in \Omega(k^\delta)$, which is a polynomial bound.

\cref{lem:Helly} discusses the \textit{Helly property} of trees, which will be used to prove some statements on tree-decomposition. 

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:Helly}
	Let \(T_1, \ldots, T_k\) be subtrees of a tree \(T\) such that for all $i, j \in \{1 \ldots k\}$, $V(T_i) \cap V(T_j)$ is nonempty. Then there exists a vertex in $T_1 \cap T_2 \cap \ldots \cap T_k$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	This proof is by induction on the number of vertices of $T$. Suppose $T$ has a single vertex. Then the Helly property holds. By induction, suppose the Helly property holds for all trees with at most $n$ vertices. Suppose $T$ has $n + 1$ vertices and \(T_1, \ldots, T_k\) are subtrees which satisfy the property above. Let $v$ be a leaf vertex of $T$ with neighbour $w$. If one of the subtrees $T_i = \{v\}$, then by non-empty intersection, all trees contain $v$. $v$ is the common intersection. Otherwise, consider $T - v$ and the subtrees $(T_1 - v, \ldots, T_k - v)$. If $v \in T_i \cap T_j$, then as none of the subtrees is the single vertex $\{v\}$, $w \in T_i \cap T_j$. Therefore, $T_i - v \cap T_j - v$ is non-empty. By the induction hypothesis, $T - v$ has a vertex common to all $(T_1 - v, \ldots, T_k - v)$, so \(T_1, \ldots, T_k\) has a common vertex in $T$. 
\end{proof}
The Helly property is most commonly associated with convex subsets of a Euclidean space, but other objects have the Helly property. 

\begin{proposition}\label{lem:clique}
	Let $G$ be a graph and $(T, (B_x)_{x \in V(T)})$ be a tree-decomposition. Then for every clique \(C\) in \(G\), there exists a node \(x \in V(T)\) such that \(C \subseteq B_x\).
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
	Let \(\tree\) be a tree-decomposition. Every vertex \(v\) induces a connected subtree \(T_v\) in \(T\). For any two vertices \(x, y\) in \(C\), the edge \(xy\) is inside a bag \(B_z\) corresponding to a node \(z\). Therefore, \(T_x\) and \(T_y\) intersects. Then by the Helly property, there exists a node \(v\) such that \(C \subseteq B_v\).
\end{proof}

Recall that $K_n$ is the complete graph on $n$ vertices.

\begin{corollary}\label{cor:complete_tw}
	The treewidth of $K_n$ equals $n-1$. 
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
	By \cref{lem:clique}, $\tw(K_n)\geq n-1$. Placing all vertices of $K_n$ in a single bag is a tree-decomposition of width $n-1$. Therefore, $\tw(K_n) = n-1$. 
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}\label{thm:tw_minor_closure}
	Let $G, H$ be graphs. If \(H\) is a minor of \(G\), then \(\tw(H) \leq \tw(G)\).
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
	Let \( \{T, {(B_x)}_{x} \} \) be a tree-decomposition of \(G\). Remove an edge $e$ from $G$. Then \( \{T, {(B_x)}_{x} \} \) is a tree-decomposition of $G - e$. Remove a vertex $v$ from $G$. Then \( \{ T, {(B_x - v)}_{x \in V(T)} \} \) is a tree-decomposition of $G - v$. Contract an edge $vw$ in $G$ to $u$. Define a new tree-decomposition $\tree'$ by relabelling \(v\) and \(w\) in all $B_x$ to \(u\). $\tree'$ is a valid tree-decomposition of $G / uv$. The induced subtree of \(u\) is the union of the induced subtrees of \(v\) and \(w\), which share a node. As $v$ and $w$ share the edge $vw$, then there exists a bag $B_x$ such that $v, w \in B_x$. Every neighbour of \(v\) or \(w\) is a neighbour of \(u\). The edges in the neighbourhood do not change. Notice that the size of each bag in each operation does not increase. Therefore, if $H \leq G$ by a series of vertex deletions, edge deletions, and edge contractions, the tree-decomposition \( \{T, {(B_x)}_{x} \} \) of $G$ can have the algorithm applied above to build a tree-decomposition of $H$ with width at most the tree-decomposition of $G$. Then by the minimality of the treewidth, \(\tw(H) \leq \tw(G)\). 
\end{proof}

This implies that the set of graphs $\left\{G : \tw(G) \leq k\right\}$ is a minor-closed class. 

\begin{proposition}\label{lem:treewidth_forest}
	Let $G$ be a graph. The treewidth of $G$ equals $1$ if and only if \(G\) is a forest.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
	For the forwards direction, suppose $G$ is not a forest. Then \(G\) has a cycle \(C\), so $G$ has a $K_3$-minor. By \cref{cor:complete_tw}, $\tw(K_3) = 2$. By \cref{thm:tw_minor_closure}, $2 \leq \tw(G)$. Therefore, $G$ has treewidth at least 2. 

	For the backwards direction, suppose \(G\) is a tree. Root the graph \(G\) at the vertex \(r\). Then let \(T = G\). For all non-root vertices $x$, let \(B_x:= \lbrace x, p \rbrace\) where \(p\) is the parent of \(x\). The bag \(B_r\) will just contain \(r\). Then all edges \(vw\) will be between parent \(v\) and child \(w\), so the edge $vw$ will be in bag \(B_w\). Finally, the subgraph induced by vertex \(x\) in \(T\) will be \(B_x\) and the children of \(B_x\), which is a connected subtree.

	If \(G\) is a forest, then perform this operation on every connected component of \(G\) and connect the root vertices to form a new tree. Then this tree is a tree-decomposition of $G$. This forms a tree-decomposition of width 1. An example is in \cref{fig:tree-treedecomp}.

	\end{figure}
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}\label{ex:tw_outerplanar}
	The treewidth of an outerplanar graph $G$ is at most 2.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
	Let \(G'\) be a \textit{weak triangulation} of \(G\), meaning that every face except for the outerface has three vertices. Since \(G\) is a minor of \(G'\), \(\tw(G) \leq \tw(G')\). Then look at the \textit{weak dual} of \(G'\). This is a tree \(T\), where every node \(v_f\) in \(T\) corresponds to an internal face \(f\) in \(G'\). Then let \(B_{v_f}\) be the bag of the tree-decomposition, where \(B_{v_f}\) is the set of vertices on the boundary of the face \(f\). Then the tree \(T\) with bags \(B_{v_f}\) is a valid tree-decomposition of \(G'\). Every vertex is on the boundary of some internal face, so every vertex is in some bag. Every bag has at most 3 vertices. Furthermore, every edge is on the boundary of some internal face, so every edge is in some bag. Finally, let $v$ be a vertex. Then the bags that contain $v$ are connected in $T$. This is because the sequence of internal faces which are adjacent to $v$ are connected in $T$. Thus, \(\tw(G) \leq 2\). Refer to \cref{fig:outerplanar_treedecomp} for an example of a tree-decomposition. The green vertices and black edges are an outerplanar graph. The red vertices and blue edges are the weak dual. The magenta circles around green vertices are examples of bags in the tree-decomposition.

\end{proof}

In fact, graphs of treewidth at most 2 have a simple characterisation.

\begin{proposition}\label{prop:k4-minor}
	A graph $G$ has treewidth at most 2 if and only if $G$ is $K_4$-minor free. 
\end{proposition}

To prove \cref{prop:k4-minor}, the following lemma is used:
\begin{lemma}
	Every $3$-connected graph have a $K_4$ minor. 
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	Suppose $G$ is $3$-connected. Let $u, v \in V(G)$ be distinct vertices. By $3$-connectedness, there are three internally disjoint paths $P, Q, R$ from $u$ to $v$. Without loss of generality, there exists a vertex $p$ on $P -\{u, v\}$ and $q$ on $Q -\{u, v\}$ where there exists a path $S$ on $G - \{u, v\}$. By finding a minimal path, there exists a path $S'$ internally disjoint from $P, Q, R$ which goes from a vertex in $P - \{u, v\}$ to a vertex in $Q - \{u, v\}$. Then $P \cup Q \cup R \cup S'$ is a $K_4$ minor in $G$. 
\end{proof}

This implies that every $K_4$-minor-free graph is not $3$-connected, therefore every $K_4$-minor-free graph contains a vertex of degree at most 2. Next, we prove \cref{prop:k4-minor}.

\begin{proof}
	For the forwards direction, suppose $G$ contains $K_4$ as a minor. Then from \cref{thm:tw_minor_closure}, $\tw(G) \geq \tw(K_4) = 3$. Therefore, $G$ has treewidth greater than 2. 

	For the backwards direction, we use induction on the number of vertices. Suppose $G$ is $K_4$-minor free. For the base case, suppose $G$ is $K_3$. Then $G$ has a tree-decomposition where every bag contains at most $3$ vertices. Now suppose $|V(G)| > 3$. Then $G$ contains a vertex $v$ of degree at most 2. Take $u, w$ to be the neighbours of $v$. Now contract $v$ into $u$. By induction on the number of vertices, $G / \{uv\}$ is also $K_4$-minor free and has a tree-decomposition of width 2. As $vw$ is an edge, there exists a bag $B$ that contains $u$ and $w$. Then add a leaf bag $B'$ to $B$ containing $u, v, w$. This is a tree-decomposition of $G$ with treewidth at most 2. Thus shown. 
\end{proof}

%Define a \(k\)-tree inductively. The complete graph \(K_{k+1}\) is a \(k\)-tree. If \(G\) is a \(k\)-tree, then adding any new vertex to \(G\) that is adjacent to a $k$-clique in \(G\) results in another \(k\)-tree.
%A \(k\)-tree is a maximal graph with treewidth \(k\). The following is a well-known fact about $k$-trees. \todo{should there be a proof of this statement?}
%\begin{proposition}
%	For every graph $G$, \(\tw(G) \leq k\) if and only if \(G\) is a subgraph of a \(k\)-tree.
%\end{proposition}

%$k$-trees characterise edge-maximal graphs with bounded treewidth.


\begin{proposition}\label{thm:treewidth_clique-minor-free}
	Every graph with treewidth at most $t$ is $K_{t+2}$-minor free. 
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
	Proof by contrapositive. Let $G$ be a graph with a $K_t$ minor. Then \(\tw(G) \geq t-1\).
	If \(K_t\) is a minor of \(G\), then from \cref{thm:tw_minor_closure}, \(\tw(K_t) \leq \tw(G)\). As \(\tw(K_t) = t-1\), then \(\tw(G) \geq t - 1\). Therefore, if $\tw(G) \leq t$, then $K_{t+1}$ is the largest complete minor in $G$. Therefore, $G$ is $K_{t + 2}$-minor free. 
\end{proof}

A graph $G$ is \textit{$k$-degenerate} if every subgraph $H \subseteq G$ has a vertex of degree at most $k$. 

\begin{proposition}
	Every graph with treewidth at most $k$ is $k$-degenerate.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
	Let \( (B_{x: x \in V(T)}) \) be a tree-decomposition of $G$. Suppose for neighbouring bags $B_x, B_y$, $B_x \nsubseteq B_y$ and $B_y \nsubseteq B_x$. If $B_x \subseteq  B_y$, then contracting the edge $xy \in T$ is a tree-decomposition of $G$. Now take a leaf bag $B_1$ and let $B_2$ be its neighbour. Now let $v$ be a vertex in $B_1$ but not in $B_2$. $v$ has degree at most $k$ as there are $k+1$ vertices in $B_1$. As subgraphs of $G$ have treewidth at most $k$, then $G$ is $k$-degenerate.
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}\label{prop:treewidth_edge_bound}
	For every graph $G$ where $|V(G) \geq k$, if $\tw(G) \leq k$ then $|E(G)|\leq k |V(G)| - \binom{k + 1}{2}$. 
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
	Proof by induction. Suppose $|V(G)| = k$. Then $|E(G)| \leq \binom{k}{2} = k |V(G)| - \binom{k + 1}{2}$. 

	Fix $n > k$. Assume this property holds for every graph with $n-1$ vertices and treewidth at most $k$. Let $G$ be a graph where $\tw(G) \leq k$ and $G \leq n$. Now $G$ is $k$-degenerate, so $G$ has a vertex $v$ of degree at most $k$. $G - v$ has treewidth at most $k$. Then by the inductive hypothesis, $|E(G - v)| \leq k (n - 1) - \binom{k + 1}{2}$. $v$ has at most $k$ neighbours, so $|E(G)| \leq k(n -1) + k - \binom{k + 1}{2} = k |V(G)| - \binom{k + 1}{2}$. 
\end{proof}
