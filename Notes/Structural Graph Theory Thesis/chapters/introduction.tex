\chapter{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}
Graphs are an important mathematical object which are the object of study in graph theory. 
Structural graph theory is a fundamental topic in graph theory. Many results from structural graph theory decompose graphs, or families of graphs, into smaller graphs with bounded parameters. One of the most important theorems in structural graph theory is the Graph Minor Theorem by \textcite{robertsonGraphMinorsXX2004}. It states that every proper minor-closed graph family is characterised by a finite set of forbidden minors. Structural graph theory has connections to topological graph theory, extremal graph theory and algorithmic complexity. 

Topological graph theory is also a fundamental topic in graph theory. The main objects of study in topological graph theory are graphs embedded on topological spaces. Topological graph theory is used in data science, optimisation, and computer science. The topological spaces that this report is concerned on are surfaces and quotient spaces of surfaces.
