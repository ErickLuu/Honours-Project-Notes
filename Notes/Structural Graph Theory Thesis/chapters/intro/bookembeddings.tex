\subsection{Book-embeddings}
A \textit{book-embedding} of a graph \(G\) is an embedding of \(G\) on a book, where all the vertices are arranged on the spine and all the edges are placed on a single page so that no edges cross. The \textit{pagenumber} of a graph \(G\) is the minimum number of pages of a book required to embed \(G\).
An embedding of $K_5$ in three pages is in \cref{fig:book-embedding}.
