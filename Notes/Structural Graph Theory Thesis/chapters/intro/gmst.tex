\subsection{Graph Minor Structure Theorem}
\textcite{robertsonGraphMinorsXVII1999} provides a rough characterisation of all \(K_t\)-minor-free graphs. 

Every graph that is $K_t$-minor-free can be constructed from the following ingredients. This is a coarse characterisation of $K_t$-minor-free graphs, meaning that a subset, or a single one of these ingredients constitutes a $K_t$-minor-free graph. 
\begin{itemize}
	\item Graphs of bounded Euler genus.
	\item Sets of apex vertices.
	\item Graphs of bounded treewidth.
	\item Sets of vortices on graphs.
\end{itemize}
\textcite{robertsonGraphMinorsXVII1999} showed that every \(K_t\)-minor-free graph can be built up from smaller graphs with the above ingredients.
