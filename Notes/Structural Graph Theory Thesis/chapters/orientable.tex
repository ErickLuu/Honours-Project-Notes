\chapter{Book-embeddings and orientable surfaces}\label{chap:orientable}

This chapter explores book-embeddings involving graphs on orientable surfaces. We first discuss a paper by \textcite{heathPagenumberGenusGraphs1992} on book-embeddings of graphs of bounded orientable genus. Afterwards, the proof of Heath and Istrail is modified to allow vortices on a graph embedded on a surface. This is done by using basic topological tools and a new concept when dealing with book-embeddings of graphs on surfaces, monochromatic pages.
