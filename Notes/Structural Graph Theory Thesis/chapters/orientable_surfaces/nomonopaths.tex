\section{Book-embeddings and paths}

We conjecture the following:

\begin{conjecture}\label{conj:fsk_be}
	Let $G$ be a graph and let $(B_1, \ldots, B_n)$ be a path-decomposition of $G$ of width $k$. Let $P$ be a path $(x_1, \ldots, x_b)$ where $x_i \in B_i$. 

	Given an $s$-page book-embedding $(<, \psi)$ of $P$, there exists an $f(s, k)$ book-embedding of $G$ that preserves the given book-embedding of $P$.
\end{conjecture}

If \cref{conj:fsk_be} holds, then it implies the following:

\begin{corollary}\label{corr:fsk_be}
	Let $G$ be a graph, where $G = G_0 \cup G_1 \cup \ldots \cup G_p$. $G_0$ is embedded on a surface $\Sigma$ with Euler genus $g$, and $G_i$ is a vortex on $G_0$ on a face $F_i$ of width $k$. If every graph embedded on $\Sigma$ has a book-embedding on $s$ pages, there exists a $p f$ book-embedding of $G$, where $f = f(s, k)$.
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
	Let $D_i$ be the $G$-clean disk on $F_i$ on which $G_i$ sits. Add chords to $F_i$ that do not cross $D_i$ so that the boundary of $F_i$ is a cycle $C_i$. Let $\Lambda_i= (x_1, \ldots, x_n)$ be the circular ordering of the vertices $D_i \cap F_i$, so the path-decomposition $(B_1, \ldots , B_n)$ is rooted on $\Lambda_i$. Extend this path-decomposition from $\Lambda_i$ to $C_i$ by adding copies of bags to every vertex in $C_i$ not in $\Lambda_i$.

	Go along $C_i$, starting at $x_1$. If a vertex $u_j$ is encountered in $C_i$ that is not in $\Lambda_i$, insert a copy of the previous bag rooted at $u_{j-1}$ and add $u_j$ to $\Lambda_i$ after $u_{j-1}$.
	
	Then the path-decomposition is on a path which starts at $x_1$ and goes around $C_i$.  
	This graph $G'$ is embedded on a surface $\Sigma$, so can be embedded on $s$ pages. From \cref{conj:fsk_be}, $G_i$ can be embedded on $f(s, k)$ pages without changing the order of the vertices on $C_i$.

	Then repeat for every vortex. The number of pages needed to embed every vortex is $p f$ where $f = f(s, k)$. 
\end{proof}

This implies \cref{conj:bded_had_pn} in the case when $\Sigma$ is an orientable surface or projective plane, through \cref{thm:apex_vertices_pagenumber} and \cref{thm:gmst}. 

However, we have no evidence for or against \cref{conj:fsk_be}.
