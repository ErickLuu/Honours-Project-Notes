Suppose $G$ is a graph with a path-decomposition \[X_1,(A_{1,i})_i, Z_2,\ldots, X_n, (A_{n,i})_i,Z_n,(B_{n-1, i})_i, Z_{n-1}, (B_{n-1, i})_i, \ldots,(B_{2,1})_i Z_1\] where $(A_{s,i})_i$ is a subpath of bags. Furthermore, $|B_i|, |C_i|, |A_{s,i}| \leq k$ for all $i$. Suppose that this path-decomposition is rooted on \[P = x_1,(a_{1,i})_i, x_2,\ldots, x_n, (a_{n,i})_i,z_n,(b_{n-1, i})_i, z_{n-1}, (b_{n-1, i})_i, \ldots, (b_{2,i})_i, z_1,\] 
where $(a_{s,i})_i$, $(b_{s,i})_i$ is a path.
Then let \[\sigma = x_1, z_1, (a_{1,i})_i x_2 z_2, (a_{2,i})_i, \ldots x_n z_n, (b_{n-1, i})_i, (b_{n-2, i})_i, \ldots (b_{1, i})_i.\] Then there is a book-embedding $(\leq, \phi)$ of $G$ which preserves $\sigma$.
