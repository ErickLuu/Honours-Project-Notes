However, the following proposition holds. Let $P$ be a path. A \textit{$k$-perturbation} of $P$ is an operation that partitions $P$ into subpaths $P_1, \ldots, P_n$ and for every $P_i$, $k$ vertices are moved to the front of $P_i$. 

\begin{proposition}\label{prop:k-perturbation}
	Let $G$ be a graph with a path $P = (P_1, P_2, \ldots, P_m)$ such that $P_i = (x_{i,1}, x_{i,2}, \ldots, x_{i, n_{i}})$ is a subpath of $P$. Suppose further $G$ has a path-decomposition \[(B_{1,1}, B_{1,2}, \ldots, B_{1,n_{1}}, \ldots, B_{m, n_{m}})\] such that $x_{i,j} \in B_{i,j}$ and $|B_{i,j}| \leq k$. Given any $\ell$-perturbation $P'$ of $P$, there is a $(k + 1 + \ell)$-page book-embedding of $G$ respecting $P'$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
	Let $A_i$ be the set of vertices moved to the front of $P_i$, and let $D_i$ to be the set of vertices that are not moved in $P_i$. Then $P' = A_1 D_1 A_2 D_2 \ldots A_m D_m$. 
	Let $v$ be a vertex in $G$ and let $h(v)$ be the first bag encountered in the path-decomposition that contains $v$.
	Let $C_{i,j} = \{v \in V(G): h(v) = (i,j)\}$. Place $C_{i,j}$ after the vertex $x_{i,j}$ in $P'$ to form the linear ordering $<$.

	Let a new path-decomposition of $G$ be \[B_{1,1} \cup A_1, B_{1,2} \cup A_1, \ldots B_{1, n_1} \cup A_1, B_{2,1} \cup A_2, \ldots, B_{2,n_2} \cup A_2.\] Then this is a path-decomposition of $G$. Using \cref{thm:pw_book_embedding}, there is a book-embedding of $G$ on $(k + 1 + \ell)$ pages respecting $P'$. 

\end{proof}

Let $G$ be a plane graph and let $F$ be a face on $G$. Suppose $F$ is rooted at a torso $R$. Let $H$ be the graph with vertex set the torsos on the boundary of $F$, ignoring $R$ and two torsos $J, K$ are connected if $V(J) \cap V(K) \neq \emptyset$. Then the depth of $F$ is the size of the largest connected component of $F$. An example of face-depth is in \cref{fig:face_depth}.

\end{figure}

\begin{proposition}
	Suppose $G = G_0 \cup G_1$. Suppose further that $G_0$ is embedded on a surface, $G_1$ is a vortex of width $\ell$ embedded on a face $F$ of depth $k$ with respect to a root $R$. If $G_0$ can be embedded on $s$ pages, then $G$ can be embedded on $(3k + s + \ell + 1)$ pages.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
	Let $S$ be the walk around the face $F$, and let $C$ be a cycle around the face $F$. Then $C$ does not intersect the $G$-clean disk that $G_1$ is on. Break $C$ into subpaths that contain a single connected component of $3$-connected torsos. Then each subpath will have at most $3k$ vertices that are moved to the very front, and since each subpath do not share a vertex, these subpaths are disjoint. So $3k$ vertices are moved to the very start in the book-embedding, from \cref{thm:Planar Graph Hickingbotham Bound} This is a $3k$-perturbation of $C$. By \cref{prop:k-perturbation}, $G_1$ can be embedded on $(3k + s + \ell + 1)$ pages. 
\end{proof}

Since there exist planar graphs with faces with an unbounded number of depth $k$ faces, this is not useful for finding a total bound for every planar graph. Therefore, another method will have to be found to embed any planar graph where every face has a bounded number of $k$-perturbed paths.
