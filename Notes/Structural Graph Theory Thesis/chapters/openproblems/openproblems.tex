In this section, we collate the open problems that remain yet to be solved.

\begin{conjecture}
    Every $K_t$-minor-free graph can be embedded on $f(t)$ pages.
\end{conjecture}

This is the main conjecture. The proof given by Blankenship is incomplete as it does not handle the minor-closed class of graphs embedded on a fixed non-orientable surface. This leads us to the next open problem.

\begin{conjecture}
    Every non-orientable genus $g$ graph can be embedded on $f(g)$ pages.
\end{conjecture}
