\subsection{Question 3}

\subsubsection{a}
Using the 1 point compatification, we have that the solid torus is produced of $S^3 - U$. Embed $U$ in $S^3$ on the $z$-axis, which passes through $\infty$. Then we have that $S^3 - U$ is simply $\mathbb{R}^3$ without the $z$-axis, which is homeomorphic to the solid torus. 
\subsubsection{b}
From above, we have that $\pi_1(S^3 - U) = \mathbb{Z}$ as this is the fundamental group of the solid torus. It can also be seen by the only nontrivial loop (up to homotopy) being ones which wrap around the hole left behind by $U$. 
\subsubsection{c}
Label one of the loops $U$ and the other loop $L$. We have that on the left the homotopy equivalence class of $L$ in $S^1 - U$ is nontrivial but on the right the homotopy class of $L$ in $S^1 - U$ is trivial. Therefore, we have that the left and the right cannot be equivalent as homeomorphisms sends homotopy equivalence classes to each other in the natural way. 

\subsection{6}
We have that $M(n)$ is a smooth manifold. Now consider the function $\det : M(n) \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, which is a smooth function between two manifolds as it is a polynomial. Now look at $\det^{-1} (1)$, which is precisely the matrices of determinant $1$. Now we want to show that the Jacobian on this set is not the zero vector, so that the preimage is a submanifold. 

Then as we have that $(D \det A)_{ij} = (-1)^{i + j} \det(A^*_{i, j})$ where $A^*_{i, j}$ is the cofactor matrix of $A$ deleting $i$ and $j$. Then this means that this is zero iff the determinant of the cofactor matrix is zero, but this is never the case as the determinant of $A$ itself is nonzero, meaning $A$ is invertible and so are all of its cofactors. Therefore, $D \det(A)$ is 0 iff $\det A = 0$, meaning that the preimage is a submanifold. 

Finally, we have that the dimension is $n^2-1$ and the codimension is 1. 

\section{Sheet 2}

\subsection{2}
Show that $A \cup B$ is homeomorphic to $S^1$. Then use Schoenflies to show that $A \cup B$ has an interior and an exterior. Then use a homeomorphism taking $A \cup B$ to the disc, with one point at (1, 0) and another point at (-1, 0). The ambient isotopy should be easy to find at this point. 

\subsection{3}
Suppose Jordan Line Theorem is true. Let $L$ be a simple closed curve in $S^2$. Then take $N$ to be on $L$ and stereograph project to $L'$ in $\mathbb{R}^2$. Then $L'$ divides up plane to two halves by Jordan Line Theorem. Then we go backwards and project both the two components and $L$ back to $S^2$. 

Suppose Jordan Curve Theorem is true. Take line $L$ in $\mathbb{R}^2$. Then stereograph project $L$ to $S^2$. Will divide into two sections. Then stereograph project $L'$ and 2 components to $\mathbb{R}^2$.  

\subsection{4}
Consider thickening the plane in the $z$ axis by dragging it to $[-1,1]$ and letting the two open sets be $z > -1/2$ and $z < 1/2$ with intersection homeomorphic to the plane. 
\subsection{5}
Take any arc $L$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$ and a plane $P$. There is an isotopy of $P$ to the $xy$-plane. Then there exists an ambient isotopy from the arc to the $x$-axis. 

\subsection{6}

Take any arc and have an ambient isotopy from the plane to the $xy$-plane. Then there is an ambient isotopy to $S^1$.

\subsection{1}
\subsubsection*{a}
Take a point $(e^{2\pi i \theta}, e^{2 \pi i \varphi})$ on $T^2 \cong S^1 \times S^1$ where $S^1 \subset \mathbb{C}$. The preimage of this set in $\mathbb{C}$ is $(m + \theta) + i (n + \varphi)$ where $m, n \in \mathbb{Z}$. Consider the open neighbourhood $U = (e^{2 \pi i (\theta - 1/100)}, e^{2 \pi i (\theta + 1/100)}) \times (e^{2 \pi i (\varphi - 1/100)}, e^{2 \pi i (\varphi + 1/100)})$. Then $p^{-1}(U)$ are the points $x + i y$ where $x \in (\theta + m -1/100, \theta + m + 1/100)$, $y \in (\varphi + n - 1/100, \varphi + n + 1/1000)$, and $m, n \in \mathbb{Z}$. Then the open sheets are of the form $U_{m,n} = \{x + i y : m + \theta - 1/100 \leq x \leq m + \theta + 1/100, n + \varphi - 1/100 \leq y \leq n + \varphi + 1/100\}$ for some $m, n \in \mathbb{Z}$. These sheets are disconnected for each $m, n$. Finally, $p|_{U_{m,n}}$ is the map from $(\theta + m -1/100, \theta + m + 1/100) \times (\varphi + n - 1/100, \varphi + n + 1/100)$ to $(e^{2 \pi i (\theta - 1/100)}, e^{2 \pi i (\theta + 1/100)}) \times (e^{2 \pi i (\varphi - 1/100)}, e^{2 \pi i (\varphi + 1/100)})$. This is a bijection and a homeomorphism, as $n \mapsto e^{2 i \pi n}$ is a homeomorphism on the range $[\theta - 1/100, \theta + 1/100]$ for any $\theta$. 

\subsubsection*{b}
$\exp$ is a continuous map as it is entire. Let $R e^{i \theta}$ be a point in $\mathbb{C} - 0$. The preimage of this point are the points $(\ln(R), \theta + 2 \pi z)$ where $z \in Z$.

\subsection{2}

\begin{theorem}
    Let $X$ be a topological space and let $p : \cover \rightarrow X$ be a covering space. Let $F: I \times I \rightarrow X$ be a homotopy of paths where $F(\cdot, 0) = \gamma_0$ and $F(\cdot, 1) = \gamma_1$ rel endpoints. Suppose $F(0,t) = x_0$ and $F(1, t)= x_1$. $\tilde{x}_0 \in p^{-1}(x_0)$ there exists a unique lifted homotopy $f_t: I \rightarrow \cover$ of paths starting at $x_0$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    For each $F(s, t) \in X$, there exists open sheets $U_{F(s, t)}$ that contains $F(s, t)$ and is evenly covered. Because $F(s, t)$ is continuous, then $F^{-1}(U_{F(s, t)})$ are open in $I \times I$. By the compactness of $I \times I$, there exists a finite number of intervals $0 = s_0 < s_1 < \cdots < s_m = 1$ and $0 = t_0 < t_1 \ldots < t_n = 1$ such that intervals $[s_i, s_{i + 1}] \times [t_j, t_{j + 1}]$ is contained inside some $U_{F(s,t)}$.

    From the path lifting theorem, there exists a unique path $\widetilde{\gamma_0} : I \rightarrow \tilde{X}$ where $\widetilde{\gamma_0}(0) = \tilde{x}_0$. Now induct over $t_i$. Let $\gamma_i = F(\cdot, t_i)$. Suppose for induction, $\widetilde{\gamma_i}$ is the unique path of $\gamma_i$. Let $\widetilde{\gamma_i}(0) = \tilde{x}_0$. Then there exists a homotopy from $\widetilde{\gamma_i}$ to $\widetilde{\gamma_{i + 1}}$. Consider $[0, s_1] \times [t_i, t_{i + 1}]$. Then there exists a neighbourhood $U_{s, t}$ which contains $ \tilde{x}_0$ where $[0, s_1] \times [t_i, t_{i + 1}]$. Now define the path \todo{finish later!}
\end{proof}

\subsection{2}
Let $K$ and $K'$ be two null-homotopic knots on $T^2$. Then there exists an ambient isotopy of $T^2$ taking $K$ to $K'$.

Let $h : \mathbb{C} \rightarrow T^2$ be the standard covering map.  Without loss of generalisation, suppose $K'$ lifts to a simple closed curve in $\{x + i y : x \in [0, 1], y \in [0, 1]\} \subset \mathbb{C}$. 
Since $K$ and $K'$ are null-homotopic, they lift to loops $\widetilde{K}, \widetilde{K'}$  in $\mathbb{C}$ from Hatcher 1.31. There exists an ambient isotopy from $\widetilde{K}$ to $\widetilde{K'}$ by 2.10. Furthermore, there is a homeomorphism from $\widetilde{K'}$ to $K'$ as it lies in a fundamental region.  

Then there exists an ambient isotopy $\gamma$ in $\mathbb{C} \cong \mathbb{R}^2$ from $\widetilde{K}$ to $\widetilde{K'}$ by Corr 2.6. Therefore, $h \circ \gamma \circ h^{-1}$ is an ambient isotopy from $K$ to $K'$. This map is well-defined as $h|_{\gamma \circ h^{-1}(K')}$ is a homeomorphism. By the equivalency of ambient isotopy, any two null-homotopic knots are ambient isotopic. 

Note that $T^2$ can be replaced by any surface $S$ which have a universal cover of $\mathbb{C}$ or $\mathbb{R}$. 

\subsection{3}
Show that the homeomorphisms isotopic to the identity is a normal subgroup and that two maps are isotopic iff they are in the same coset mod identity homeomorphisms.
Firstly, we will show that $N$ is a subgroup of $\Homeo(S)$. Firstly, if $g \in N$, then $g^{-1} \in N$. Let $H(x, t) : S \times I \rightarrow S$ be an isotopy where $h_0 = Id$ and $h_1 = g$. Then $G(x, t) = h_1^{-1}(H(x, 1-t))$ is a continuous map by composition. Furthermore, $G(x, 0) = h_1^{-1}(H(x, 1)) = Id$ and $G(x, 1) = h_1^{-1}(H(x, 0)) = g^{-1}$. Therefore, $g^{-1}$ is isotopic to $N$. If $f$ and $g$ are isotopic to $N$ with isotopies $F$ and $G$ with $F_1 = f$, $G_1 = g$, $F_0 = G_0 = Id$, then $f \circ g$ is isotopic to $Id$ with isotopy:
\begin{equation*}
    H(x, t) =
    \begin{cases}
        F(x, 2t) & 0 \leq t \leq 1/2\\
        G(F(x, 1), 2t-1) & 1/2 \leq t \leq 1
    \end{cases}
\end{equation*}
This is continuous as this is a composition of continuous functions and at time $t = 1/2$, the two maps agree. At time $t = 0$, $H_0 = Id$ and at $t = 1$, $H_t = g \circ f$. Therefore, if $f, g \in N$, then $g \circ f \in N$. 

Now we will show that $N$ is normal in $\Homeo(S)$. 
Let $f \in \Homeo(S)$, $g \in N$. Then $f g f^{-1} \in N$. Let $G: S \times I \rightarrow S$ be an isotopy with $G_0 = Id$, $G_1 = g$. Then $H(x, t) = f \circ G(\cdot, t) \circ f^{-1} (x) $ is an isotopy. Firstly, $H(x, t)$ is continuous as it is a composition of continuous functions for fixed $x$ and fixed $t$. Then $H(x, 0) = f \circ g_0 \circ f^{-1} = f \circ Id \circ f^{-1} = f \circ f^{-1} = Id$. Then $H(x, 1) = f \circ g_1 \circ f^{-1} = f \circ g \circ f^{-1}$. Therefore, $f \circ g \circ f^{-1} \in N$. Therefore, $N$ is normal.

Finally, suppose $f$ is isotopic to $g$. Then $f^{-1} g \in N$. Take an isotopy $F : S \times I \rightarrow S$ where $F_0 = f$ and $F_1 = g$. Then take $H(x, t) = f^{-1}(F(x, t))$. This is continuous, as this is the composition of two continuous functions. Then $H_0 = f^{-1} \circ f = Id$ and $H_1 = f^{-1} \circ g$. Therefore, $f$ and $g$ are in the same coset. 

Suppose $f^{-1} g \in N$. Then there exists a isotopy $F : S \times I \rightarrow I$ where $F_0 = Id$ and $F_1 = f^{-1} g$. Then take $H = f \circ F$. This is continuous as it is the composition of two continuous functions. Furthermore, $F_0 = f \circ Id = f$ and $F_1 = f \circ f^{-1} \circ g = g$. Therefore, $f$ and $g$ are isotopic.  

\subsection{4}
We want to show that $GL(2, \mathbb{Z})$ is generated by $
\begin{bmatrix}
    1 & 1\\
    0 & 1\\
\end{bmatrix},
\begin{bmatrix}
    1 & 0\\
    1 & 1\\
\end{bmatrix},
\begin{bmatrix}
    0 & 1\\
    1 & 0\\
\end{bmatrix}$. We want to show that any matrix in $GL(2, \mathbb{Z})$ can be reduced to the identity by applying a series of the matrices above, and then taking the inverse of the operations to build back the matrix. 
Suppose $\begin{bmatrix}
    a & b\\
    c & d\\
\end{bmatrix} \in GL(2, \mathbb{Z})$. Therefore, $ad - bc = \pm 1$.

If $A = \begin{bmatrix}
    a & b\\
    c & d\\
\end{bmatrix}$
has determinant $-1$, then 
$\begin{bmatrix}
    a & b\\
    c & d\\
\end{bmatrix} 
\begin{bmatrix}
    0 & 1\\
    1 & 0\\
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
    b & a\\
    d & c\\
\end{bmatrix}
$ has determinant 1. Therefore, consider the case when $ad - bc = 1$.

If $|a| > |c| > 0$, then do the operation:

\begin{equation*}
    \begin{bmatrix}
        1 & \pm 1\\
        0 & 1
    \end{bmatrix}
    \begin{bmatrix}
        a & b\\
        c & d\\
    \end{bmatrix}
    = 
    \begin{bmatrix}
        a \pm c &b\\
        c & d
    \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation*}
so that $|a \pm c| < |a|$.
If $|a| \leq |c| > 0$, then do the operation:
\begin{equation*}
    \begin{bmatrix}
        1 & 0\\
        \pm 1 & 1
    \end{bmatrix}
    \begin{bmatrix}
        a & b\\
        c & d\\
    \end{bmatrix}
    = 
    \begin{bmatrix}
        a &b\\
        c \pm a & d
    \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation*}
such that $|c \pm a| < |c|$. Repeat this operation until the matrix becomes:
\begin{equation*}
    \begin{bmatrix}
        \gcd(a, c) & x\\
        0 & y\\
    \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation*}
for some $x, y \in \mathbb{Z}$. However, $ad - bc = 1$. As $ax - yc = k \gcd(a, c)$ over $\mathbb{Z}$ for some $k \in \mathbb{Z}$, then $\gcd(a, c) = 1$. Therefore, 

\begin{equation*}
    A' = \begin{bmatrix}
        1 & x\\
        0 & y\\
    \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation*}
However, $\det(A') = 1$ as $A'$ is the composition of matrices with determinant 1. Therefore, $y = 1$. Therefore, $A'$ is of the form

\begin{equation*}
    \begin{bmatrix}
        1 & x\\
        0 & 1\\
    \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation*}
for some integer $x \in \mathbb{Z}$. But $
\left(\begin{bmatrix}
    1 & 1\\
    0 & 1\\
\end{bmatrix}\right)^x = \begin{bmatrix}
    1 & x\\
    0 & 1\\
\end{bmatrix}$. Therefore, $A$ can be composed from the above three matrices. 

\subsection{5}
Call all homeomorphisms isotopic to $id$ null-isotopies. 

Between any two points $p_0, p_1 \in S^2$, there is a null-isotopy such that $f(p_0) = p_1$. This is done by rotating the sphere around. 

Take any $f$ which is orientation preserving. Then pick a point $p_0$. Then there exists a null-isotopy $\gamma : S^2 \rightarrow S^2$ such that $\gamma(f(p_0)) = p_0$, through a rotation of the sphere. Then $ \gamma \circ f$ is an isotopy that takes $p_0$ to $p_0$ (This step could be simplified with a Brower-type proof). However, $S^2 \cong D^2/{\partial D^2}$. Consider the quotient map $q : D^2 \rightarrow S^2$, where $p_0$ is the point on $\partial D^2$. Let $g : D^2 \rightarrow D^2$ such that $g \circ q = \gamma \circ f$. This map exists as $\gamma \circ f$ keeps $p_0$ fixed and changes $S^2 - \{p_0\}$, so $g = \gamma \circ f$ on the open disk under the map. Then $g|_{\partial D^2} = Id$. Then by Alexander's isotopy lemma, $g$ is an isotopy. Therefore, $\gamma \circ f$ is also an isotopy, therefore $f$ is an isotopy. Thus shown. 

Orientation-reversing homeomorphims cannot be transformed to orienting preserving homeomorphisms on $S^2$.

\section{5}
\subsection{1}
Let $S$ be homeomorphic to the surface $K = (S^2)_g \# T_1 \# ... \# T_g$, where all boundaries are on $S^2$. Then let $a_0, ... a_{g-1}$ be sccs where $a_i$ is on the intersection of $T_{i}$ and $T_{i + 1}$ and $a_0$ is on the intersection of $(S^2)_g$ and $T_1$. Then let $\alpha$ be a nonseparating scc on $K$. There exists a homeomorphism $j : K \rightarrow K$ such that $j(\alpha)$ is the meridian loop only on $T_g$. Now let $\gamma$ be $a_h$. Then $K - \gamma \cup j(\alpha)$ will have components of genus $h$ and another component of genus $g - h - 1$. Therefore, $K - j^{-1}(\gamma) \cup \alpha$ will also have components of genus $h$ and $g - h - 1$. Thus shown. 
\subsection{2}
\subsubsection{a}
Let $\alpha, \alpha'$ and $\beta, \beta'$ be isotopic with isotopies $h_\alpha$ and $h_\beta$. Firstly, $h_\beta$ maps $\beta$ to $\beta'$ along a strict homeomorphism. Because this map is an ambient isotopy, all transverse intersections between $\beta$ and $\alpha$ must either be moved along $\alpha$, be removed as part of some bigon, or added as some part of a bigon. 

However, every bigon on a surface bounds a disk so traversing the boundary of the bigon must hold that the crossing must go left and then right. Therefore, the algebraic sum of the bigon is $0$. 
Therefore, $\inter(\alpha, \beta') =  \inter(\alpha, \beta)$. Now repeat this argument for $\inter(\alpha, \beta')$ and $\inter(\alpha', \beta')$ but traverse along $\beta'$ instead, and use subsection $b$. 

\subsubsection{b}
Proof by picture. At every point in $\alpha \cap \beta$, consider traversing along $\alpha$ and then traversing along $\beta$. If at this point $i = \pm 1$ along $\alpha$ then along $\beta$ $i = \mp 1$. Red is $\alpha$, black is $\beta$. 

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includesvg{Figures/w5Q2svg.svg}
\end{figure}

Therefore, $\inter(\alpha, \beta) = - \inter(\beta, \alpha)$. 
As a consequence, setting $\beta = \alpha$, $\inter(\alpha, \alpha) = - \inter(\alpha, \alpha)$. Therefore, $\inter(\alpha, \alpha) = 0$. 

\subsection{3}
\subsubsection{a}
Outside of a neighbourhood of $a$, $T_a^k b$ and $b$ do not intersect. On this neighbourhood, when $b$ crosses $a$, the Dehn twist will cross over $b$ $|k| i(a, b)$ times. This is because the twist passes by every point in $a \cap b$ $|k|$ times. As this is done for every point in $a \cap b$, then the number of crossings is $|k| i(a, b)^2$. 

\subsubsection{b}
Let $\alpha$ be an essential simple closed curve. Suppose for contradiction $T^k_\alpha$ is the identity in $MCG(S)$, and $k$ is the smallest nonzero that has this property. Then for all curves $\beta$, $T_a^k(\beta) \sim \beta$. But this means that $i(T^k_a(\beta), \beta) = 0$ for all $\beta$. But as $a$ is essential, let $\beta$ be a curve such that $i(a, \beta) = 1$. Therefore, $0 = |k| i(a, b)^2$, so $0 = |k|$. Thus contradiction. 

\subsection{4}
\subsubsection{a}

Let $T_a$, $T_b$ be two Dehn twists around simple closed curves.

If $a$ and $b$ are essential and do not intersect, consider $S - a \cup b$ be a cut along $a$ and $b$. Then this cut has halves $b_1$ and $b_2$ which are glued together to form $S - a$. Then if $b_1$ and $b_2$ are on the same component of $S - a \cup b$, draw an arc $c$ from $b_1$ to $b_2$ at points which are identified to be the same point in $S$. Then as $c$ only touches $b$ once, $i(b, c) = 1$ as there is no operation to turn a single crossing into no crossing, and $i(a, c) = 0$. 

Now suppose if $b_1$ and $b_2$ are on different components $S_1, S_2$. Since $b$ is essential, $S_1$ and $S_2$ contain a either boundary components or a handle. Then there is an arc that can be drawn on $S_1$ to two points $s_1, s_2$ on $b_1$ that either goes through a handle or around a disk. Do this for $s_1$ and $s_2$ on $S_2$. Call this curve $c$.

If either $S_1$ or $S_2$ have a handle, then $c$ will go on the handle. Then $c$ and $b$ do not form a bigon and therefore must intersect at least once. Then if either $S_1$ or $S_2$ have more than 2 holes, then $c$ cannot be moved through $a$ to not intersect $b$, by going around both holes. Since $a$ is not equal to $b$, neither $S_1$ nor $S_2$ is a disk, so there must be either two holes in one component as the total number of holes on the surface is at least 3 if there are no handles. Therefore, $c$ does exist. 
\subsubsection{b}
Let $c$ be a curve which follows $a$ but does not cross $a$. Then $c$ will cross $b$ near where $a$ crosses $b$. Thus shown. 

\subsubsection{c}
Let $a$ and $b$ be curves. Take $c$ to be the curve from part a or b, so $i(a, c) = 0$ and $i(b, c) \neq 0$. Then $i(T_a(c), c) = i(a, c)^2 = 0$, but $i(T_b(c), c) = i(b, c)^2 \neq 0$. This is from part 3. 
\subsection{d}
Suppose $a = b$. Then $T_a = T_b$ up to isotopy. Now suppose $a \neq b$. Then there exists a curve $c$ such that $i(T_a(c), c) = 0$ but $i(T_b(c), c) \neq 0$. Therefore, $T_a \neq T_b$ as it does not preserve the intersection number of curves up to isotopy. Thus shown both directions.

\subsection{5}
\subsubsection{a}

Let $f \in MCG(S)$. Let $a, b$ be isotopy classes of $SCC$ in $S$. Show $T_{f(a)} f = f T_a$. Hit both sides with $b$. Then $T_{f(a)} f(b)$ is a Dehn twist of $f(b)$ around $f(a)$. $T_a b$ is a Dehn twist of $b$ around $a$. However, outside of a neighbourhood of $f(a)$, $T_f(a) f(b) = f(T_a(b))$. Therefore, what is important is what goes on inside the neighbourhood of $b$. By homeomorphisms, $f(a \cap b) = f(a) \cap f(b)$. Therefore, the places where the point twists right are the same in both sections. Therefore, $T_{f(a)} f = f T_a$ and $T_{f(a)} = f T_a f^{-1}$. 

\subsubsection{b}

If both $a$ and $b$ are nonseparating, there exists a homeomorphism $f$ from $S^2 \rightarrow S^2$ that takes $a$ to $b$, by sheet 5, question 6. Then $T_b = f T_a f^{-1}$. 

\subsubsection{c}

If $f$ commutes with $T_a$, then $T_{f(a)} = T_{a}$. Therefore, $f(a) = a$. If $f(a) = a$, then $T_{f(a)} = T_{a}$. Therefore, $T_{f(a)} = f T_{a} f^{-1} = T_a$, so $f T_a = T f_a$.

\subsection{6}

\subsubsection{Reflexive}
For all scc $a$, $a \twequiv a$, through no twists.

\subsection{Symmetric}
Suppose $a \twequiv b$ through $b = T_1 T_2 ... T_m a$. Then $a = T_m^{-1} ... T_1^{-1}b$. This comes out of $T_i$ being a group element in $MCG^+(S)$ so group elements are associative and have inverses. Additionally, the inverse of $T_i$ is $T_i^{-1}$, the left Dehn twist as applying both to any curve returns something isotopic to the original curve. 

\subsubsection{Transitive}
Let $a, b, c$ be curves such that $a \twequiv b$ and $b \twequiv c$. Then $a \twequiv c$. 

Let $a = T_1 T_2 ... T_m b$ and $b = T_{m + 1} T_{m + 2}... T_{m + n} c$. Then $a = T_1 T_2 ... T_m T_{m + 1} ... T_{m + n} c$. Therefore, $a \twequiv c$. This comes from $T_i$ being a 

\subsection{7}

\subsubsection{a}
If $p$ is disjoint from $H_i$ then $P$ lives on the component of $S - c_1, ..., c_g$ homeomorphic to the sphere with $g$ holes. As every scc on a sphere minus holes is separating, $p$ must be separating.

Firstly, $T_a T_b a = b$ is equivalent to $T_{T_a T_b(a)} = T_b$ from exercise 4. But this is equivalent to $(T_a T_b) T_a (T_a T_b)^{-1} = T_b$ from the definition of conjugation in exercise $5$. But this is equivalent to $T_a T_b T_a = T_b T_a T_b$. Therefore, this satisfies the braid relation. 

\paragraph*{ii}
We want to show that for all curves $c$, $i(a, c) = i(a, T_a(c))$. Take any curve $c$. Then doing a Dehn twist of $c$ around $a$ only shifts the intersection point to another place on $a$. Furthermore, this operation introduces no bigons as any new bigon in the Dehn twist is already a bigon in $c$. Therefore, $i(a, c) = i(a, T_a(c))$. Therefore, $i(a, T_b a) = i(a, T_a T_b a) = i(a, b)$. 
Therefore, $i (a, b) = i(a, T_b(a)) = i(a, b)^2$ from exercise 3. Therefore, $i(a, b) = 1$.
\paragraph*{iii}
From part ii, $T_a T_b a = b$ if and only if $i(a, b) = 1$. From part i, $T_a T_b a = b$ if and only if $T_a T_b T_a = T_b T_a T_b$. Therefore, $i(a, b) = 1$ if and only if $T_a T_b T_a = T_b T_a T_b$.
