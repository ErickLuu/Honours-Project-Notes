\section{Question 1}
\subsection{Part a}
There is a bijection from $W_n$ to placing $k$ balls in $n$ urns labelled $1 .. n$. Let $[w_1, w_2, ..., w_{k}]$ be a sequence in $W_n$.
Therefore, $|W_n| = \binom{n + k - 1}{k}$. 
There is a bijection from $S_n$ to choosing $k$ numbers in $[n]$...
Therefore, $|S_n| = \binom{n}{k}$. 
\subsection{Part b}
If we let $m = n + k - 1$, then we have that $|S_m| = \binom{n + k - 1}{k} = |W_n|$. 
\subsection{Part c}
We have that the function $\phi: S_{n + k - 1} \rightarrow W_n$, where it sends $[s_1, S_2, ..., S_{k}]$ to $[s_1, s_2 - 1, ..., s_{k} - k + 1]$, is a bijection. Proof...
\section{Question 2}
\section{Question 3}
We have that $T_{n, 0} = 1$, as there is only one way to arrange students such that they are in line.

We have that $T(2, 1) = 2$, $T(n, 1) = 2n - 1$.
