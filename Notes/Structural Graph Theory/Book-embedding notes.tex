\section{Book embedding}
A \textit{book embedding} of a graph $G$ is an arrangement of the vertices of $G$ in an ordered sequence $v_1, v_2, ..., v_n$ and a colouring of the edges of $G$ into partitions such that each edge $v_av_b, v_c v_d$ (where $a < b$ and $c < d$), if they are assigned the same colour, does not have the property that $v_a < v_c < v_b < v_d$ or $v_c < v_a < v_d < v_b$, i.e. the edges $v_a v_b$ and $v_c v_d$ do not cross. Equivalently, we can treat the vertices as lying on the "spine" of a series of half-planes in $\mathbb{R}$ and each edge is drawn on the half plane such that no two edges cross on each sheet. There is also an alternative definition where we think about a \textit{circular ordering} of the vertices rather than a linear ordering, so each vertex lies on a cycle. Then we can view the page-embedding as stacking discs on top of each other such that the edges on each disc is a planar subgraph. We wish to minimise the number of pages used given a particular graph embedding. We refer to the minimum number of pages necessary to draw a graph $G$ in this way as the \textit{page-number} of $G$, or alternatively the \textit{book-thickness}, or \textit{stack-number} of the graph $G$. We denote the page-number of a graph $G$ as $\pn(G)$. Page-numbers were introduced by Bernhart and Kainen \url{https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0095895679900212?via%3Dihub}.
\subsection{Graphs with bounded page number}
\begin{lemma}
	A graph $G$ has page-number at most 1 iff $G$ is an outerplanar graph.
\end{lemma}

\begin{lemma}
	A graph $G$ has pagenumber at most 2 iff $G$ is a subgraph of a planar graph with a Hamiltonian cycle. This is because we can embed the graph on a sphere with the vertices and Hamiltonian cycle on the equator, and the edges forming the interior and exterior edges of the cycle respectively.
\end{lemma}

\subsection{Planar graphs}
\begin{theorem}
	Planar graphs can be embedded on at most four pages.
\end{theorem}
The proof of this will be shown below.

\subsection{Historical interest}
Pagenumbers were developed for processor designs, but more recently have been used in bioinformatics and the like. 
The project of finding upper and lower bounds of the pagenumber of planar graphs was started by Bernhart and Kainen when they conjectured that planar graphs had unbounded page-number. However, Buss and Shor \url{https://users.monash.edu.au/~davidwo/PAPERS/StacksQueues/BussShor-PagenumberPlanar.pdf} found that the pagenumber of planar graphs was at most 9, and Heath \url{https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/715903} found that the pagenumber of planar graphs is at most 7. Yannakakis' devised an algorithm to bound the pagenumber to at most 4 \url{https://users.monash.edu.au/~davidwo/PAPERS/StacksQueues/Yannakakis-4pages-JCSS89.pdf}. It was conjectured by Yannakakis that there exist planar graphs with pagenumber 4, but only recently were planar graphs found with pagenumber 4. 
\subsection{Other graphs}
We have that $K_n$ complete graphs can be embedded on $\lceil n/2 \rceil$ pages. Therefore for any graph $G$ on $n$ vertices, $\pn(G) \leq \lceil n/2 \rceil$. 

\section{Characterisations of $K_t$-minor free graphs}
What is the structure of $K_t$-minor free graphs? We shall show that we can roughly characterise all $K_t$-minor free graphs as graphs that are products of a series of operations. 
\subsection{$K_t$-minor free minor-closed families}
We define $\had(G)$ to be the largest $t$ such that $G$ has a $K_t$ minor. 
\subsubsection{Planar graphs}
\begin{theorem}
	If $G$ is a planar graph, then $G$ is $K_5$-minor-free.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	If $G$ is planar with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges, then we have that $m \leq 3n -6$. However, we have that $K_5$ has $5$ vertices and $10$edges, but we have that $ 10 > 3 \times 5 - 6$, so $K_5$ is not planar. As the family of planar graphs is minor-closed, then if $G$ is planar, then $K_5$ is minor-free.
\end{proof}

\subsubsection{Genus-g graphs}
We define the genus $g$ of a surface to be 2 times the number of handles + the number of crosscaps. From topology, we have that we can add a handle to crosscaps to form 3 crosscaps. Therefore, the Euler characteristic $\chi = 2 - g$ for both orientable and non-orientable surfaces. Note that the genus is defined slightly differently from topology. We do this to allow non-orientable and orientable surfaces to coincide in definition.

We can show that if $G$ has genus $g$, then if $G$ has $n$ vertices and $m$ edges, then $n - m + f = \chi = 2-g$, then as each face has at most 3 vertices and each edge is incident to two faces, we have that $f \leq 2m/3$. Therefore, $m \leq 3(n + g - 2)$, and if $K_t$ is embeddable on a genus $g$ graph, then $\binom{t}{2} \leq 3 (t + g - 2)$. Thus $t \leq \sqrt{6g} + 4$. So if a graph has genus $g$, then it is $K_t$-minor-free, where $t > \sqrt{6g} + 4$. 

\subsubsection{Bounded treewidth graphs}
\begin{theorem}
	If $\tw(G) \leq k$, then $G$ is $K_{k+2}$-minor-free. 
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	We shall prove the contrapositive: If $K_t$ is a minor of $G$, then $tw(G) \geq t-1$.
	If $K_t$ is a minor of $G$, and $\tw(G) \leq k$, then we have that $\tw(K_t) \leq \tw(G) \leq k$, but $\tw(K_t) = t-1 \leq k$, so $t \leq k + 1$. Thus shown a family of minor-closed which are $K_t$-minor free. 
\end{proof}
\subsubsection{Apex vertices}
An apex vertex $v$ is added to a graph $G$ such that it has arbitrary edges. As such, it can simply dominate all other vertices in $G$. Then if $G$ is $K_t$-minor free, $G$ with the apex vertex $v$ is $K_{t+1}$- minor free. 
\subsubsection{Clique-sums}
The \textit{$k$-clique-sum} of two graphs $G$ and $H$, denoted as $G \# H$, is the graph obtained by performing a series of operation on the cliques of $G$ and $H$. We find cliques in $G$ and $H$, $C_G$ and $C_H$ respectively, such that $C_G$ and $C_H$ have size $k$. Then we identify the vertices in $C_G$ and $C_H$ so that $G$ and $H$ are connected to each other on this clique. 

\begin{lemma}
	If $G = G_1 \# G_2$,then $\had(G) = \max(\had(G_1), \had(G_2))$ and $\tw(G) = \max(\tw(G_1), \tw(G_2))$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{example}
	If $G$ is the clique-sum of Euler genus $g$ graphs, then $G$ is $K_{\sqrt{6g} + 5}$-minor-free, but has unbounded genus.
\end{example}

\begin{theorem}[Wagner's theorem]
	If $G$ is $K_5$-minor-free, then $G$ can be obtained from $\leq 3$-clique-sums of planar graphs and the Wagner graph $W_8$.
\end{theorem}


\subsection{Torsos and adhesion}
Given a graph $G$ and a tree-decomposition $\tree$, the \textit{torso} of a bag $B_x$ of $T$ is the graph $G\langle B_x \rangle$, obtained from $G[B_x]$ where $vw$ is a vertex in $G\langle B_x \rangle$ iff $v,w \in B_x \cap B_y$, where $y$ is a neighbour of $x$ in $T$. So the set $B_x \cap B_y$ for all neighbours $y$ of $x$ in $T$ is a clique in $G\langle B_x \rangle$. 
The \textit{adhesion} of a tree is defined as $\max(|B_x \cap B_y|)$ where $xy$ is an edge in $T$.

\subsubsection{Vortices}
Let $G$ be embedded on a surface $\Sigma$, and let $F$ be a face on $G$. Let $D$ be a disc in $\Sigma$ such that $D$ only intersects $G$ only on vertices on the boundary of $F$. We denote these discs as $G$-clean. 

Then let $\Lambda = (x_1, x_2, ..., x_b)$ be a tuple of vertices on the boundary of $F$ such that they intersect $D$. Then we define a new graph $H$ such that $V(G) \cap V(H) = \Lambda$, and there is a path-decomposition of $H$ of bags $B_1, B_2, ... B_b$ such that $x_i \in B_i$ for all $i$. $H$ is denoted as a \textit{$D$-vortex} of $G$. The width of a $D$-vortex is the width of the path above, or $\max_i(|B_i| - 1)$. 

Vortices were created to solve the problem of grid-like graphs with large treewidth, torsos and adhesion, yet are all $K_t$-free for bounded $t$. 
\subsection{Robertson-Seymour theorem}
Given $g, p, a \geq 0$, $k \geq 1$, a graph $G$ is $(g, p, k, a)$- almost embeddable if there exists an $A \subseteq V(G)$ with $|A| \leq a$, and there exists subgraphs $G_0, G_1, ...,  G_{p'}$ of $G$ such that:
\begin{itemize}
	\item $G - A = G_0 \cup G_1 \cup G_2 ... G_{p'}$
	\item $p' \leq p$
	\item There is an embedding of $G_0$ onto a surface $\Sigma$ of genus $\leq g$
	\item There exists pairwise disjoint $G_0$-clean discs $D_1, D_2, ..., D_{p'}$ in $\Sigma$
	\item $G_i$ is a $D_i$-vortex of width at most $k$.
\end{itemize}

\begin{theorem}[Robertson-Seymour graph structure theorem for $K_t$-minor-free graphs]
	For all $t$, there exists $g, p, a \geq 0$, $k \ell \geq 1$, such that every $K_t$-minor-free graph has a tree-decomposition of adhesion $\leq \ell$ and each torso is $(g, p, k, a)$-embeddable. 
\end{theorem}
In fact, there exists a function $t(g, p, k, a)$ such that if a graph has a tree-decomposition of adhesion $\leq \ell$ and each torso is $(g, p, k, a)$-almost embeddable, then $G$ has no $K_t$ minor. We can show that such a function is $t(g, p, k, a) = a + ck \sqrt{g + p}$. 

\section{Bounds of pagenumbers of graphs}
\begin{theorem}
	Let $g$ be the genus of a graph $G$. We have that for all graphs $G$, $\pn(G) \leq O(g)$ for some $g$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}[Heath and Istrail]
	
\end{proof}
Note that this bound extends the one found by Yannakakis. 
The best known bound is $\sqrt{g}$, found by Malitz. (cite here).

We additionally have that $\pn(G) \leq \tw(G) + 1$, from \url{https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00454-007-1318-7}. 
We also have that bounded clique-sums of graphs of bounded treewidth also have bounded path-number.
What is a sticking-point is vortices of graphs on bounded genus, and cliquesums of vortices on bounded genus as well.
