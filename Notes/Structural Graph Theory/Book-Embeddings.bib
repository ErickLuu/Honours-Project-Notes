  abstract = {An embedding of a graph in a book consists of a linear order of its vertices along the spine of the book and of an assignment of its edges to the pages of the book, so that no two edges on the same page cross. The book thickness of a graph is the minimum number of pages over all its book embeddings. Accordingly, the book thickness of a class of graphs is the maximum book thickness over all its members. In this paper, we address a long-standing open problem regarding the exact book thickness of the class of planar graphs, which previously was known to be either three or four. We settle this problem by demonstrating planar graphs that require four pages in any of their book embeddings, thus establishing that the book thickness of the class of planar graphs is four.},

Its proof, due to Neil Robertson and Paul Seymour, takes well over 500 pages.},

  abstract = {The book-embedding problem arises in several area, such as very large scale integration (VLSI) design and routing multilayer printed circuit boards (PCBs). It can be used into various practical application fields. A book embedding of a graph G is an embedding of its vertices along the spine of a book, and an embedding of its edges to the pages such that edges embedded on the same page do not intersect. The minimum number of pages in which a graph G can be embedded is called the pagenumber or book-thickness of the graph G. It is an important measure of the quality for book-embedding. It is NP-hard to research the pagenumber of book-embedding for a graph G. This paper summarizes the studies on the book-embedding of planar graphs in recent years.},

In this paper, it is proven that genus g graphs can be embedded in O(g) pages, thus disproving the conjecture. An Ω(g1/2) lower bound is also derived. The first algorithm in the literature for embedding an arbitrary graph in a book with a non-trivial upper bound on the number of pages is presented. First, the algorithm computes the genus g of a graph using the algorithm of Filotti, Miller, Reif (1979), which is polynomial-time for fixed genus. Second, it applies an optimal-time algorithm for obtaining an O(g)-page book embedding. Separate book embedding algorithms are given for the cases of graphs embedded in orientable and nonorientable surfaces. An important aspect of the construction is a new decomposition theorem, of independent interest, for a graph embedded on a surface. Book embedding has application in several areas, two of which are directly related to the results obtained: fault-tolerant VLSI and complexity theory.},

This paper examines the book-embedding problem for k-trees. A book embedding of a graph maps the vertices onto a line along the spine of the book and assigns the edges to pages of the book such that no two edges on the same page cross. The pagenumber of a graph is the minimum number of pages in a valid book embedding. In this paper, it is proven that the pagenumber of a k-tree is at most k+1. Furthermore, it is shown that there exist k-trees that require k pages. The upper bound leads to bounds on the pagenumber of a variety of classes of graphs for which no bounds were previously known.},
