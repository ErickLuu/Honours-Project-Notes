The first algorithm in the literature for embedding an arbitrary graph in a book with a non-trivial upper bound on the number of pages is presented. First, the algorithm computes the genus g of a graph using the algorithm of Filotti, Miller, Reif (1979), which is polynomial-time for fixed genus. Second, it applies an optimal-time algorithm for obtaining an O(g)-page book embedding. Separate book embedding algorithms are given for the cases of graphs embedded in orientable and nonorientable surfaces. An important aspect of the construction is a new decomposition theorem, of independent interest, for a graph embedded on a surface. Book embedding has application in several areas, two of which are directly related to the results obtained: fault-tolerant VLSI and complexity theory.},

A book embedding of a graph maps the vertices onto a line along the spine of the book and assigns the edges to pages of the book such that no two edges on the same page cross. The pagenumber of a graph is the minimum number of pages in a valid book embedding. In this paper, it is proven that the pagenumber of a k-tree is at most k+1. Furthermore, it is shown that there exist k-trees that require k pages.

The minimum number of colours, taken over all drawings of G, is the classical graph parameter thickness. By restricting the edges to be straight, we obtain the geometric thickness. By additionally restricting the vertices to be in convex position, we obtain the book thickness. This paper studies the relationship between these parameters and treewidth. Our first main result states that for graphs of treewidth k, the maximum thickness and the maximum geometric thickness both equal ⌈k/2⌉. This says that the lower bound for thickness can be matched by an upper bound, even in the more restrictive geometric setting. Our second main result states that for graphs of treewidth k, the maximum book thickness equals k if k ≤ 2 and equals k + 1 if k ≥ 3. This refutes a conjecture of Ganley and Heath [Discrete Appl. Math. 109(3):215-221, 2001]. Analogous results are proved for outerthickness, arboricity, and star-arboricity.},

Many important RNA molecules, however, contain pseudo-knots, a structural feature that is excluded explicitly from the conventional definition of secondary structures. We propose here a generalization of secondary structures incorporating ‘non-nested’ pseudo-knots, which we call bi-secondary structures, and discuss measures for the complexity of more general contact structures based on their graph-theoretical properties. Bi-secondary structures are planar trivalent graphs that are characterized by special embedding properties. We derive exact upper bounds on their number (as a function of the chain length n) implying that there are fewer different structures than sequences. Computational results show that the number of bi-secondary structures grows approximately like 2.35n. Numerical studies based on kinetic folding and a simple extension of the standard energy model show that the global features of the sequence-structure map of RNA do not change when pseudo-knots are introduced into the secondary structure picture. We find a large fraction of neutral mutations and, in particular, networks of sequences that fold into the same shape. These neutral networks percolate through the entire sequence space.},

  abstract = {A k-stack layout (respectively, k-queue layout) of a graph consists of a total order of the vertices, and a partition of the edges into k sets of non-crossing (non-nested) edges with respect to the vertex ordering. A k-track layout of a graph consists of a vertex k-colouring, and a total order of each vertex colour class, such that between each pair of colour classes no two edges cross. The stack-number (respectively, queue-number, track-number) of a graph G, denoted by sn(G) (qn(G), tn(G)) is the minimum k such that G has a k-stack (k-queue, k-track) layout. This paper studies stack, queue, and track layouts of graph subdivisions. It is known that every graph has a 3-stack subdivision. The best known upper bound on the number of division vertices per edge in a 3-stack subdivision of an n-vertex graph G is improved from \$\textbackslash mathcal\{O\}(\{\textbackslash rm log\} n) to \textbackslash mathcal\{O\}(\{\textbackslash rm log min\}\textbackslash\{sn(G), qn(G)\textbackslash\})\$. This result reduces the question of whether queue-number is bounded by stack-number to whether 3-stack graphs have bounded queue number. It is proved that every graph has a 2-queue subdivision, a 4-track subdivision, and a mixed 1-stack 1-queue subdivision. All these values are optimal for every non-planar graph. In addition, we characterise those graphs with k-stack, k-queue, and k-track subdivisions, for all values of k. The number of division vertices per edge in the case of 2-queue and 4-track subdivisions, namely \$\textbackslash mathcal\{O\}(\{\textbackslash rm log\}\{\textbackslash sf qn\}(G))\$, is optimal to within a constant factor, for every graph G. Applications to 3D polyline grid drawings are presented. For example, it is proved that every graph G has a 3D polyline grid drawing with the vertices on a rectangular prism, and with \$\textbackslash mathcal\{O\}(\{\textbackslash rm log\}\{\textbackslash sf qn\}(G))\$.},

  abstract = {In graph theory, a book embedding is a generalization of planar embedding of a graph to embeddings in a book, a collection of half-planes all having the same line as their boundary. Usually, the vertices of the graph are required to lie on this boundary line, called the spine, and the edges are required to stay within a single half-plane. The book thickness of a graph is the smallest possible number of half-planes for any book embedding of the graph. Book thickness is also called pagenumber, stacknumber or fixed outerthickness. Book embeddings have also been used to define several other graph invariants including the pagewidth and book crossing number. Every graph with n vertices has book thickness at most                         ⌈         n                    /                  2         ⌉                 \{\textbackslash displaystyle \textbackslash lceil n/2\textbackslash rceil \}    , and this formula gives the exact book thickness for complete graphs. The graphs with book thickness one are the outerplanar graphs. The graphs with book thickness at most two are the subhamiltonian graphs, which are always planar; more generally, every planar graph has book thickness at most four. All minor-closed graph families, and in particular the graphs with bounded treewidth or bounded genus, also have bounded book thickness. It is NP-hard to determine the exact book thickness of a given graph, with or without knowing a fixed vertex ordering along the spine of the book. Testing the existence of a three-page book embedding of a graph, given a fixed ordering of the vertices along the spine of the embedding, has unknown computational complexity: it is neither known to be solvable in polynomial time nor known to be NP-hard. One of the original motivations for studying book embeddings involved applications in VLSI design, in which the vertices of a book embedding represent components of a circuit and the wires represent connections between them. Book embedding also has applications in graph drawing, where two of the standard visualization styles for graphs, arc diagrams and circular layouts, can be constructed using book embeddings. In transportation planning, the different sources and destinations of foot and vehicle traffic that meet and interact at a traffic light can be modeled mathematically as the vertices of a graph, with edges connecting different source-destination pairs. A book embedding of this graph can be used to design a schedule that lets all the traffic move across the intersection with as few signal phases as possible. In bioinformatics problems involving the folding structure of RNA, single-page book embeddings represent classical forms of nucleic acid secondary structure, and two-page book embeddings represent pseudoknots. Other applications of book embeddings include  abstract algebra and knot theory.},

  abstract = {A book embedding of a graph consists of a linear ordering of the vertices along a line in 3-space (the spine), and an assignment of edges to half-planes with the spine as boundary (the pages), so that edges assigned to the same page can be drawn on that page without crossings. Given a graph G = (V,E), let f : V → ℕ be a function such that 1 ≤ f(υ) ≤ deg(υ). We present a Las Vegas algorithm which produces a book embedding of G with \$\$O(\textbackslash sqrt \{|E| \textbackslash cdot \textbackslash max \_\textbackslash upsilon  \textbackslash left\textbackslash lceil \{\textbackslash deg (\textbackslash upsilon )/f(\textbackslash upsilon )\} \textbackslash right\textbackslash rceil \} )\$\$pages, such that at most f(v) edges incident to a vertex v are on a single page. This algorithm generalises existing results for book embeddings. We apply this algorithm to produce 3-D orthogonal drawings with one bend per edge and O(∣V ∣3/2∣E∣) volume, and single-row drawings with two bends per edge and the same volume. In the produced drawings each edge is entirely contained in some Z-plane; such drawings are without so-called cross-cuts, and are particularly appropriate for applications in multilayer VLSI. Using a different approach, we achieve two bends per edge with O(∣V ∣∣E∣) volume but with cross-cuts. These results establish improved bounds for the volume of 3-D orthogonal graph drawings.},

  abstract = {The main goal of this paper is to prove a new additivity theorem for the genus of a graph. The theorem is true only by making a natural modification to the definition of the genus of an embedding. The (generalized) genus of a graph G will equal the connectivity of the minimum connected surface for which G is embeddable. The connectivity of a surface equals the genus if it is unorientable and twice the genus if it is orientable. We show that (generalized) genus is additive over edge (vertex) amalgams, i.e., if G is obtained from disjoint graph, H1 and H2 by identifying an edge (vertex) in H1 with an edge (vertex) in H2 then generalized genus of G equals the sum of the generalized genus of H1 plus the generalized genus of H2. We introduce a new combinatorial representation of an embedding which seems to lend itself to combinatorial arguments for embedding of graphs on unoriented surfaces.},
