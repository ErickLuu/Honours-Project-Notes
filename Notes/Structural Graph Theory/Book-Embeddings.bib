Clique matrices also play a natural role in parameterising positive de nite matrices under zero constraints on elements of the matrix. We show that clique matrices can parameterise all positive de nite matrices restricted according to a decomposable graph and form a structured Factor Analysis approximation in the non-decomposable case.},

  abstract = {In 1943, Hadwiger conjectured that every graph with no \$K\_t\$ minor is \$(t-1)\$-colorable for every \$t\textbackslash ge 1\$. In the 1980s, Kostochka and Thomason independently proved that every graph with no \$K\_t\$ minor has average degree \$O(t\textbackslash sqrt\{\textbackslash log t\})\$ and hence is \$O(t\textbackslash sqrt\{\textbackslash log t\})\$-colorable. Recently, Norin, Song and the second author showed that every graph with no \$K\_t\$ minor is \$O(t(\textbackslash log t)\textasciicircum\{\textbackslash beta\})\$-colorable for every \$\textbackslash beta {$>$} 1/4\$, making the first improvement on the order of magnitude of the \$O(t\textbackslash sqrt\{\textbackslash log t\})\$ bound. The first main result of this paper is that every graph with no \$K\_t\$ minor is \$O(t\textbackslash log\textbackslash log t)\$-colorable. This is a corollary of our main technical result that the chromatic number of a \$K\_t\$-minor-free graph is bounded by \$O(t(1+f(G,t)))\$ where \$f(G,t)\$ is the maximum of \$\textbackslash frac\{\textbackslash chi(H)\}\{a\}\$ over all \$a\textbackslash ge \textbackslash frac\{t\}\{\textbackslash sqrt\{\textbackslash log t\}\}\$ and \$K\_a\$-minor-free subgraphs \$H\$ of \$G\$ that are small (i.e. \$O(a\textbackslash log\textasciicircum 4 a)\$ vertices). This has a number of interesting corollaries. First as mentioned, using the current best-known bounds on coloring small \$K\_t\$-minor-free graphs, we show that \$K\_t\$-minor-free graphs are \$O(t\textbackslash log\textbackslash log t)\$-colorable. Second, it shows that proving Linear Hadwiger's Conjecture (that \$K\_t\$-minor-free graphs are \$O(t)\$-colorable) reduces to proving it for small graphs. Third, we prove that \$K\_t\$-minor-free graphs with clique number at most \$\textbackslash sqrt\{\textbackslash log t\}/ (\textbackslash log \textbackslash log t)\textasciicircum 2\$ are \$O(t)\$-colorable. This implies our final corollary that Linear Hadwiger's Conjecture holds for \$K\_r\$-free graphs for every fixed \$r\$. One key to proving the main theorem is a new standalone result that every \$K\_t\$-minor-free graph of average degree \$d=\textbackslash Omega(t)\$ has a subgraph on \$O(t \textbackslash log\textasciicircum 3 t)\$ vertices with average degree \$\textbackslash Omega(d)\$.},

The minimum number of colours, taken over all drawings of G, is the classical graph parameter thickness. By restricting the edges to be straight, we obtain the geometric thickness. By additionally restricting the vertices to be in convex position, we obtain the book thickness. This paper studies the relationship between these parameters and treewidth. Our first main result states that for graphs of treewidth k, the maximum thickness and the maximum geometric thickness both equal ⌈k/2⌉. This says that the lower bound for thickness can be matched by an upper bound, even in the more restrictive geometric setting. Our second main result states that for graphs of treewidth k, the maximum book thickness equals k if k ≤ 2 and equals k + 1 if k ≥ 3. This refutes a conjecture of Ganley and Heath [Discrete Appl. Math. 109(3):215-221, 2001]. Analogous results are proved for outerthickness, arboricity, and star-arboricity.},

Many important RNA molecules, however, contain pseudo-knots, a structural feature that is excluded explicitly from the conventional definition of secondary structures. We propose here a generalization of secondary structures incorporating ‘non-nested’ pseudo-knots, which we call bi-secondary structures, and discuss measures for the complexity of more general contact structures based on their graph-theoretical properties. Bi-secondary structures are planar trivalent graphs that are characterized by special embedding properties. We derive exact upper bounds on their number (as a function of the chain length n) implying that there are fewer different structures than sequences. Computational results show that the number of bi-secondary structures grows approximately like 2.35n. Numerical studies based on kinetic folding and a simple extension of the standard energy model show that the global features of the sequence-structure map of RNA do not change when pseudo-knots are introduced into the secondary structure picture. We find a large fraction of neutral mutations and, in particular, networks of sequences that fold into the same shape. These neutral networks percolate through the entire sequence space.},

The first algorithm in the literature for embedding an arbitrary graph in a book with a non-trivial upper bound on the number of pages is presented. First, the algorithm computes the genus g of a graph using the algorithm of Filotti, Miller, Reif (1979), which is polynomial-time for fixed genus. Second, it applies an optimal-time algorithm for obtaining an O(g)-page book embedding. Separate book embedding algorithms are given for the cases of graphs embedded in orientable and nonorientable surfaces. An important aspect of the construction is a new decomposition theorem, of independent interest, for a graph embedded on a surface. Book embedding has application in several areas, two of which are directly related to the results obtained: fault-tolerant VLSI and complexity theory.},

Consequently, the 4CC implies Hadwiger's conjecture whent=5, because it implies that apex graphs are 5-colourable.},

  abstract = {On October 23, 1852, Professor Augustus De Morgan wrote a letter to a colleague, unaware that he was launching one of the most famous mathematical conundrums in history--one that would confound thousands of puzzlers for more than a century. This is the amazing story of how the "map problem" was solved. The problem posed in the letter came from a former student: What is the least possible number of colors needed to fill in any map (real or invented) so that neighboring counties are always colored differently? This deceptively simple question was of minimal interest to cartographers, who saw little need to limit how many colors they used. But the problem set off a frenzy among professional mathematicians and amateur problem solvers, among them Lewis Carroll, an astronomer, a botanist, an obsessive golfer, the Bishop of London, a man who set his watch only once a year, a California traffic cop, and a bridegroom who spent his honeymoon coloring maps. In their pursuit of the solution, mathematicians painted maps on doughnuts and horseshoes and played with patterned soccer balls and the great rhombicuboctahedron. It would be more than one hundred years (and countless colored maps) later before the result was finally established. Even then, difficult questions remained, and the intricate solution--which involved no fewer than 1,200 hours of computer time--was greeted with as much dismay as enthusiasm. Providing a clear and elegant explanation of the problem and the proof, Robin Wilson tells how a seemingly innocuous question baffled great minds and stimulated exciting mathematics with far-flung applications. This is the entertaining story of those who failed to prove, and those who ultimately did prove, that four colors do indeed suffice to color any map. This new edition features many color illustrations. It also includes a new foreword by Ian Stewart on the importance of the map problem and how it was solved.},
