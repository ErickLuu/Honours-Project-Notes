\chapter{Book-embeddings and surfaces}

This chapter explores book-embeddings involving graphs on surfaces. This ties together two themes in our discussion. We first discuss a paper by \textcite{heathPagenumberGenusGraphs1992} on book-embeddings of graphs of bounded orientable genus. We then discuss embedding graphs of bounded nonorientable genus.
