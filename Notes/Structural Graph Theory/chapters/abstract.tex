	We prove that \(K_t\)-minor free graphs have bounded pagenumber. This bound connects two important concepts in structural graph theory that have been studied extensively for the past 40 years. We outline the most important theorem in structural graph theory related to \(K_t\)-minor free graphs, the Graph Minor Structure Theorem. We also survey some results in graph minor theory, including treewidth and path-width. 

	Another topic in this report is topological graph theory. Our main topics are graphs embedded on surfaces and on books. We also discuss the connections between topological graph theory and graph minor theory and how the Graph Minor Structure Theorem uses topological graph theory.
