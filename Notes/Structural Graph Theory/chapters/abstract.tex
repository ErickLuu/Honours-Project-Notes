\begin{abstract}
	We aim to prove that \(K_t\)-minor-free graphs have bounded pagenumber. This bound connects two important concepts in structural graph theory that have been studied extensively for the past 40 years. The main motivation of this theorem was filling a gap in knowledge between $K_t$-minor-free graphs and pagenumber. We prove that every graph embedded on a surface with some additional structure can be embedded on a bounded number of pages, when the surface is orientable or the projective-plane. We leave proving that graphs embedded on higher genus nonorientable surfaces have bounded pagenumber as a conjecture. \todo{rewrite?}

\section{Acknowledgements}
I am grateful to David Wood for guiding and supervising me throughout this project. He has taught me everything that I know about graph theory and I would not be where I am now without his guidance. I would also like to thank fellow graph theorists Jofre Costa, Nickolai Karol, Robert Hickingbotham and Marc Distel for their support and discussions. I would also like to thank members of the Monash discrete maths community, including Ian Wanless, Nick Wormald, Daniel Horsley and Graham Farr for teaching me combinatorial and discrete mathematics and inspiring me to take this path. Additionally, I would also like to thank topologists Josh Howie, Andy Hammerlindl, Jessica Purcell and Dionne Ibarra for teaching me topology, which has been invaluable in my research. Most of all, I thank my family, friends and Diesel for supporting me through my honours year and allowing me to do my studies.
\todo{be very careful! and say what you really want to say, mention family + friends etc}
