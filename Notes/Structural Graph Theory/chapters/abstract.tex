\begin{abstract}
	We aim to prove that \(K_t\)-minor-free graphs have bounded pagenumber. This bound connects two important concepts in structural graph theory that have been studied extensively for the past 40 years. The main motivation of this theorem was filling a gap in knowledge between $K_t$-minor-free graphs and pagenumber. \textcite{Blankenship-PhD03} claimed to prove the above conjecture in her PhD thesis. However, the proof given has not been published or independently verified. We aim to have a proof published at some point for the benefit of the structural graph theory community. 

	There are two main research topics that we discuss.
	The main topic in this report is topological graph theory. The two subtopics that are most discussed are graphs embedded on surfaces and in books. We also discuss the connections between topological graph theory and graph minor theory and how the Graph Minor Structure Theorem uses topological graph theory. 
	We outline the most important theorem in structural graph theory related to \(K_t\)-minor free graphs, the Graph Minor Structure Theorem. We also survey some results in graph minor theory, including treewidth and path-width. The Graph Minor Structure Theorem is used directly to prove the above conjecture.

\section{Acknowledgements}
I am grateful to David Wood for guiding and supervising me throughout this project. He has taught me everything that I know about graph theory and I would not be where I am now without his guidance. I would also like to thank fellow graph theorists Jofre Costa, Nickolai Karol, Robert Hickingbotham and Marc Distel for their support and discussions. I would also like to thank members of the Monash discrete maths community, including Ian Wanless, Nick Wormald, Daniel Horsley and Graham Farr for teaching me combinatorial and discrete mathematics and inspiring me to take this path. Most of all, I thank my family, friends and Diesel for supporting me through my honours year and allowing me to do my studies.
