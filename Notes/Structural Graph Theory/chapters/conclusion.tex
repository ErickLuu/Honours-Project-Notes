\chapter{Conclusion}\label{chap:conclusion}

This report aims to prove \cref{conj:bded_had_pn}, that every $K_t$-minor free graph $G$ can be embedded on $f(t)$ pages. This conjecture remains unsolved. What this report has shown is that this question is a lot more difficult than originally believed. In fact, one of the corollaries of this conjecture, that all graphs embeddable on a fixed surface $\Sigma$ has bounded pagenumber, has not been solved in the case that $\Sigma$ is nonorientable. 

This report has gone through one of the most important theorems in $K_t$-minor free graphs, the Graph Minor Structure Theorem. This report explains briefly the Graph Minor Structure Theorem and the Graph Minor Theorem. This report does not go into detail about the proof of either, but uses both as tools in attempting to prove \cref{conj:bded_had_pn}. 

Next, this report goes through a discussion of book-embeddings in more detail, and discussion of treewidth and book-embeddings. The report then discusses graphs embedded on surfaces and graphs embedded on surfaces, with vortices. There is a proof of bounding the number of pages when the surface is orientable, but no proof when the surface is non-orientable with high genus.
