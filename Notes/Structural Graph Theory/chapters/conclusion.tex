\chapter{Conclusion}\label{chap:conclusion}

The main result shown is that if a graph $G$ is $K_t$-minor free, then $G$ has bounded pagenumber.
The main result used is the Graph Minor Structure Theorem~\cite{robertsonGraphMinorsXVI2003}. We apply the Graph Minor Structure Theorem to the problem and explain some partial results.
We also go through some other important results in \(K_t\)-minor free graphs and pagenumbers, including Heath and Istrail's \cite{heathPagenumberGenusGraphs1992} paper on graphs on surfaces and bounding the pagenumber.
