This report aims to prove \cref{conj:bded_had_pn}, that every $K_t$-minor free graph $G$ can be embedded on $f(t)$ pages. This conjecture remains unsolved. What this report has shown is that this question is a lot more difficult than originally believed. In fact, one of the corollaries of this conjecture, that all graphs embeddable on a fixed surface $\Sigma$ has bounded pagenumber, has not been solved in the case that $\Sigma$ is nonorientable. 

This report has gone through one of the most important theorems in $K_t$-minor free graphs, the Graph Minor Structure Theorem. This report explains the Graph Minor Structure Theorem and its connection to the Graph Minor Theorem.
