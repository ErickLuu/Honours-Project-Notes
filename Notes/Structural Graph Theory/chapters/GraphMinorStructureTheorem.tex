\chapter{Graph Minor Structure Theorem}

The Graph Minor Structure Theorem is an important coarse characterisation of $K_t$-minor free graphs. Many problems of the form: ``Every $K_t$-minor free graph has some bounded parameter, where the bound is of the form $f(t)$'' uses some form of the Graph Minor Structure Theorem in its proof. In this chapter, we break down and explain each component of the Graph Minor Structure Theorem. We then finish by discussing in more detail the Graph Minor Theorem.
