\section{Layout of report}
The following list is how the rest of the report is laid out. 
\begin{itemize}
	\item \cref{chap:gmst} discusses every component of the Graph Minor Structure Theorem and how these components combine to form the Graph Minor Structure Theorem. 
	\item \cref{chap:book-embeddings} discusses book-embeddings and book-embeddings of graphs of bounded treewidth. There is also a discussion of book-embeddings of graphs with a tree-decomposition with torsos of bounded pagenumber. 
	\item \cref{chap:orientable} discusses graphs embedded on orientable surface and a book-embedding of graphs on orientable surfaces. Additionally, graphs on orientable surfaces with vortices is also discussed with a theorem that allows vortices to be added to graphs embedded on a surface with a bounded pagenumber. 
	\item \cref{chap:nonorientable} discusses graphs embedded on nonorientable surfaces. There is a discussion of a proof of embedding projective planar graphs with a bounded number of pages and an extension of this result to vortices. There is also a discussion of the Klein Bottle case and some discussion on its difficulty. Finally, we discuss a conjecture involving non-orientable surfaces that can be used to embed any $K_t$-minor free graph on a bounded number of pages. 
\end{itemize}

Readers are expected to have at least an undergraduate understanding in graph theory and point-set topology.
