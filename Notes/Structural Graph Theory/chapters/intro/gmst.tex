\subsection{Graph Minor Structure Theorem}\label{sec:Kt_Minor_Free}
\textcite{robertsonGraphMinorsXVII1999} provides a rough characterisation of all \(K_t\)-minor free graphs. 

Each graph that is $K_t$-minor-free can be constructed from the following ingredients. This is a coarse characterisation of $K_t$-minor free graphs, meaning that a subset, or a single one of these ingredients constitute a $K_t$-minor free graph. 
\begin{itemize}
	\item Graphs of bounded Euler genus
	\item Sets of apex vertices
	\item Graphs of bounded treewidth
	\item Sets of vortices on graphs.
\end{itemize}
It was shown by \textcite{robertsonGraphMinorsXVII1999} that every \(K_t\)-minor free graph can be built up from smaller graphs with the above ingredients.
