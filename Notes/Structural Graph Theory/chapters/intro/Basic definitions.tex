A graph $G$ is a pair of sets; a vertex set $V(G)$ and an edge set $E(G)$. $E(G)$ is a set that contains two-element subsets of $V(G)$. An edge $ \{v, w\}$ \textit{joins} vertices $v$ and $w$. A graph is \textit{simple} if all edges join two distinct vertices and there is at most one edge between any two vertices. In this paper, all graphs are simple unless stated. Furthermore, all graphs $G$ are finite, so $|V(G)| < \infty$. The graph with all possible edges on $n$ vertices is the \textit{complete graph} $K_n$. Graphs are defined up to isomorphism, or up to relabelling of the vertices.
Throughout this report, the set $\lbrace 1\ldots n \rbrace$ is notated as $[n]$. 
A graph \(G\) is \(k\)-colourable if there exists a function \(f: V(G) \rightarrow [k]\) such that if $f(v) = f(w)$, then $v$ and $w$ do not share an edge. The \textit{chromatic number} \(\chi(G)\) is the smallest \(k\) such that \(G\) is \(k\)-colourable. 

Let $G$ be a graph. A \textit{subgraph} $H$ in $G$ is a graph with vertex set $V(H) \subseteq V(G)$ and edge set $E(H)$ with the property that if $vw$ is an edge in $E(H)$, then $vw$ is an edge in $E(G)$.
Let $G$ be a graph and let $S$ be a non-empty subset of the vertex set of $G$. The \textit{induced subgraph} of $S$ in $G$ is the graph $G[S]$ with vertex set $S$ and edge set containing precisely all edges in $G$ incident to two vertices in $S$. Removing a set of vertices $S \subseteq V(G)$ from $G$ forms the induced subgraph $G - S := G[V(G) - S]$. 
$H$ is a \textit{spanning subgraph} of $G$ if $H$ is a subgraph of $G$ and $V(H) = V(G)$. 
The \textit{neighbourhood} of a set of vertices $A \subseteq V(G)$ are precisely all vertices that are adjacent to a vertex in $A$ and not in $A$ and is denoted as $N_G(A)$. A \textit{clique} is a subgraph isomorphic to a complete graph.
