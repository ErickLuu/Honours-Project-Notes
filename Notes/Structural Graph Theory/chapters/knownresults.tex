\chapter{Known results from structural graph theory}\label{chap:Known results}
In this chapter, we outline important known results that will help us solve \cref{conj:bded_had_pn}.

\begin{itemize}
	\item \cref{sec:Kt_Minor_Free} is an explanation of the Graph Minor Structure Theorem.
	\item \cref{sec:Graph Minor Theorem} discusses the Graph Minor Theorem. 
	\item \cref{sec:BoundedPagenumber} are a series of proofs that can be used with the Graph Minor Structure Theorem to prove that each individual component of the structure theorem has bounded pagenumber.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \cref{ssec:Clique_sum_Pagenumber_bound} proves that tree-decompositions of bounded adhesion where each torso has bounded pagenumber also has bounded pagenumber.
		\item \cref{ssec:Bounded_Treewidth} proves that graphs with bounded treewidth also have bounded pagenumber.
		\item \cref{sec:pagenumber_bounded_genus} proves that all graphs with bounded genus have bounded pagenumber.
