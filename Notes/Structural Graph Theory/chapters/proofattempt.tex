\chapter{Potential proof techniques}\label{chap:Proving_The_Theorem}
Our aim is to show that graphs with bounded genus $g$ containing $p$ vortices of bounded width $k$ have bounded pagenumber $f(g, p, k)$. Thus we can show that for fixed $t$, all $K_t$-minor free graphs have bounded pagenumber $f(g, p, k, a, \ell)$. However, from \cite{hickingbothamStackNumberCliqueSum2023}, we can show that the clique-sums of graphs of bounded genus also have bounded genus.

We wish to find a book-embedding of a graph $G$ of bounded genus $g$ with vortices $G_1, ..., G_p$ of adhesion $k$ such that the pagenumber of $G$ is at most $f(g, p, k)$ for some constants $g$ and $p$. We do not worry about the $a$-case now.

\section{Planar graphs}
From Heath and Istrail, we can form a planar-nonplanar decomposition of $G$ of bounded genus $g$. Therefore, it makes sense to think about planar graphs first before thinking about graphs with bounded genus $g$.

We wish to prove the following:

\begin{conjecture}\label{conj:4-planar graphs}
	For all 4-connected planar graphs $G$ with an embedding $\Sigma$, with $i$ distinguished faces $\left\lbrace F_1, ..., F_i \right\rbrace$ and a distinguished clique $C$ of size at most $3$, there exists a book-embedding $(<, \psi)$ such that all edges bounding the faces $F_i$ are ``almost'' monochromatic and $C$ is at the start of the embedding with pagenumber at most $f(i)$.
\end{conjecture}

\subsection{Graphs of bounded genus}

However, this conjecture may be too difficult to prove. Then we can consider a book-embedding of graphs $g$ of bounded genus, and consider what happens if the disks were manipulated only slightly, with a bounded number of vertices on the boundary of the disks moved around. Then from using Heath and Istrail's algorithm to build the homotopy classes, we can add on the disks to the graphs of bounded genus. However, we do not know any good way of making this work properly. 
\section{Apex vertices}
In this section, we will prove that apex vertices can be added with a bounded increase to the number of pages.
\begin{theorem}
	If $G$ is a graph with components $G'$ and $A$ apex vertices and $G'$ is a graph with pagenumber $s$, $a = |A|$, then $G$ has pagenumber $s + \left\lceil \frac{3a}{2}\right\rceil$. 
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	Let $G'$ have book-embedding $(<, \rho)$. Then place the vertices of $A$ at the very start of $(<)$ and for every edge $u_iv$, $u_i \in A$, $v \in G'$, we colour $\rho(uv) = i$. Then for any edge $e \in E(G')$, we maintain the same colour as before. Then for the edges between vertices in $A$, we have that the number of colours is bounded above by $\left\lceil \frac{a}{2} \right\rceil$ from \cref{thm:Pagenumber_Complete_Graph}. Therefore, we have that $\pn(G) \leq \pn(G') + a + \left\lceil \frac{a}{2} \right\rceil =s + \left\lceil \frac{3a}{2}\right\rceil$. 
\end{proof}
