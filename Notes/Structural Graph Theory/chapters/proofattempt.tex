Our aim is to show that graphs with bounded genus $g$ containing $p$ vortices of bounded width $k$ have bounded pagenumber $f(g, p, k)$. Thus we can show that for fixed $t$, all $K_t$-minor free graphs have bounded pagenumber $f(g, p, k, a, \ell)$. However, from \cite{hickingbothamStackNumberCliqueSum2023}, we can show that the clique-sums of graphs of bounded genus also have bounded genus.

We wish to find a book-embedding of a graph $G$ of bounded genus $g$ with vortices $G_1, ..., G_p$ of adhesion $k$ such that the pagenumber of $G$ is at most $f(g, p, k)$ for some constants $g$ and $p$. It is trivial to show that apex vertices 
\subsection{Apex vertices}
In this section, we will prove that apex vertices can be added with a bounded increase to the number of pages.
\begin{theorem}
	If $G$ is a graph with partition $(G', A)$ such that $G'$ is a graph with pagenumber $s$, $|A| \leq a$, then $G$ has pagenumber $s + \left\lceil \frac{3a}{2}\right\rceil$. 
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	Let $G'$ have book-embedding $(<, \rho)$. Then place the vertices of $A$ at the very start of $(<)$ and for every edge $u_iv$, $u_i \in A$, $v \in G'$, we colour $\rho(uv) = i$. Then for any edge $e \in E(G')$, we maintain the same colour as before. Then for the edges between vertices in $A$, we have that the number of colours is bounded above by $\left\lceil \frac{a}{2} \right\rceil$ from \cref{thm:Pagenumber_Complete_Graph}. Therefore, we have that $\pn(G) \leq \pn(G') + a + \left\lceil \frac{a}{2} \right\rceil =s + \left\lceil \frac{3a}{2}\right\rceil$. 
\end{proof}

\section{Planar graphs}
From Heath and Istrail, we can form a planar-nonplanar decomposition of $G$ of bounded genus $g$. Therefore, it makes sense to think about planar graphs first before thinking about graphs with bounded genus $g$.
Let $G$ be a graph. We say that a vertex ordering $<$ preserves a face $F$ if there is a vertex $v_0$ on the boundary of $F$ and an orientation $(v_0, v_1, ..., v_k)$ around the boundary of $F$ such that $v_0 < v_1 < ... < v_k$. 
As a consequence of Tutte's theorem, we have that every 4-connected planar graph is Hamiltonian and also every face of the embedding is preserved. 

We wish to prove the following:

\begin{conjecture}\label{conj:4-planar graphs}
	For all 4-connected planar graphs $G$ with an embedding $\Sigma$, with $i$ distinguished faces $\left\lbrace F_1, ..., F_i \right\rbrace$ and a distinguished clique $C$ of size at most $3$, there exists a book-embedding $(<, \psi)$ such that all edges bounding the faces $F_i$ are ``almost'' monochromatic and $C$ is at the start of the embedding with pagenumber at most $f(i)$.
\end{conjecture}

\subsection{Graphs of bounded genus}

However, this conjecture may be too difficult to prove. Then we can consider a book-embedding of graphs $g$ of bounded genus, and consider what happens if the disks were manipulated only slightly, with a bounded number of vertices on the boundary of the disks moved around.

\begin{lemma}
	Suppose $G$ is a graph with components $G_0$ and $G'$. Suppose $G_0$ is embedded on a surface $\Sigma$ of genus $g$ and let $F$ be a face on $G_0$. Let $v_1, v_2, ..., v_k$ be the vertices bordering $F$, and let $C$ be the cycle bordering $F$. Let $D$ be a $d$-clean disk on $F$. Now suppose $G'$ is a vortex on $D$ with a path-decomposition $(B_0, ... B_l)$. Suppose $G_0$ has a book-embedding $(<, \phi)$. Then partition the edges $e_i = v_i v_{i + 1}$ (modulo $k$) such that the edges form a maximal $\phi$-monochromatic path on $C$. Suppose there are $m$ paths. Then $G$ has a book-embedding with $pn(G) + f(m)$ pages.
\end{lemma}
We shall prove this auxillary lemma for each $l$. 
\begin{lemma}
	Let $(B_1, ..., B_n)$ be a path-decomposition of $G$ with path-width $k$. Let $x_1, ..., x_n$ be vertices in $G$ such that $x_i \in B_i$ for all $i$. Then we have that for any one-page embedding of $x_1, ..., x_n$, $G$ has a $k + 1$-page embedding. 
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
	For each $v \in V(G)$, let $b(v) := \min \left\{ i : v \in B_i \right\}$. This partitions $V(G)$. Let $(\leq)$ be the one-page embedding of $x_1, ..., x_n$ and suppose we have a circular ordering. Colour the vertices such that every vertex in each bag is assigned a different colour. Now for all edges $uv$ in $E(G)$ where $b(u) \leq b(v) $, set $\phi(uv) = col(u)$. 
	
	Now for all $i$, place $b^{-1}(i)$ immediately clockwise from $x_i$. We claim that this is a book-embedding. 
	
	Suppose edges $uv$ and $xy$ are assigned the same colour, $u < v$, $u \leq x$ and $x \leq y$. Suppose $h(v) = i$. Then we can draw a line such that $B_i, B_1$ and $x_1$ is on one side and $B_{i + 1}, B_{i + 2}, ..., B_k$ from the fact that $x_1$ form a planar partition of the graph $G$. This is possible from the Jordan curve theorem and the fact that the line that goes through $x_1 ... x_k$ is planar. Then this implies that $uv$ and $xy$ do not cross. 
	If $u = x$, then we can follow the path $P$ from $x_1$ to $x_k$ to reach $u$ with no crossings. (Draw picture!)
\end{proof}



Suppose $G$ is bounded on the surface. From the lemma above, we can build a decomposition of $G$ such that every face preserves the rotation.
