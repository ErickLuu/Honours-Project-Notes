\section{Non-orientable surfaces}

\textcite{heathEmbeddingPlanarGraphs1984} did not sufficiently prove the case for non-orientable graphs. \textcite{nakamotoBookEmbeddingProjectiveplanar2015} showed that every projective-planar graph can be embedded in $9$ pages, which was improved to 6 with a more complex proof. However, we want to prove a book-embedding for all nonorientable surfaces. 
\textcite{ozekiBookEmbeddingGraphs2019} states that they were unable to prove that all Klein-Bottle graphs can be embedded on a bounded number of pages. We have also attempted to solve this conjecture, but was unsuccessful. 

\begin{conjecture}\label{conj:nonorientable}
	For a fixed natural number $g > 0$, every nonorientable genus $g$ graph can be embedded in $f(g)$ pages for some function $f$. 
\end{conjecture}

For the case that $g = 1$, then $G$ can be embedded in 6 pages, from \textcite{ozekiBookEmbeddingGraphs2019}. However, it is not known for higher $g$, and in fact the case when $g = 2$ (Klein-Bottle graphs) was stated to be an open problem. 

To be compatible with the proof of orientable surfaces, the following strengthening is necessary. 
\begin{conjecture}\label{conj:nonorientable_monochromatic_paths}
	Every graph embedded on a surface of genus $g$ can be embedded on $f(g)$ pages where every face has $h(g)$ monochromatic paths. 
\end{conjecture}

\cref{conj:nonorientable_monochromatic_paths} is a strengthening of \cref{conj:nonorientable}. This is known when the surface is orientable or a projective plane. However, it is not known in the case when $G$ is a higher genus nonorientable surface.
\cref{conj:nonorientable_monochromatic_paths} implies the following:

\begin{corollary}\label{corr:aegraphs}
	If \cref{conj:nonorientable_monochromatic_paths} Every $(g, p, k)$-almost-embeddable graph is embeddable on $p h(g) (k + 1) + f(g)$ pages.
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
	Let $G$ be a $(g, p, k)$-almost-embeddable graph, on a nonorientable surface of genus $g$. By \cref{conj:nonorientable_monochromatic_paths}, there is a book-embedding of $G$ where every face has $h(g)$ monochromatic paths. Then by \cref{lem:vortices_mono_paths}, $G$ can be embedded in $f(g) + h(g) p (k+1)$ pages. 
\end{proof}

This implies \cref{conj:bded_had_pn}.
\begin{corollary}
	Every $\mathcal{G}(g, p, k, a)$ graph can be embedded on $2s^2 + 4s + 1$ pages, where $s =  4g h(g) (k + 1) + f(g) + a$. 
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
	Let $G \in \mathcal{G}(g, p, k, a)$. Then $G$ has a tree-decomposition where every torso is $(g, p, k, a)$-almost embeddable. From \cref{corr:aegraphs} and \cref{thm:apex_vertices_pagenumber}, every torso is embeddable on $s = 4g h(g) (k + 1) + f(g) + a$ pages. Then from \cref{corr:bded_pn_tree_decomp}, $G$ is embeddable on $2s^2 + 4s + 1$ pages.
\end{proof}

Therefore, finding a book-embedding of graphs on nonorientable surface with some certain extra properties proves \cref{conj:bded_had_pn}. Finding any book-embedding of graphs on nonorientable surfaces is difficult enough.
