\section{Non-orientable surfaces}

For the nonorientable case, we wish to show that:

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:orientablevortices}
	Let $G$ be a graph where all torsos are $k$ almost-embeddable on a surface of genus at most $g$.  Now suppose there are $p$ vortices which are embedded on $G$. Then $G$ can be embedded on $(2s + 2)(s) + \ell$ pages, where $s = \gpk$. 
\end{theorem}

To prove this for the most general case, the following must be shown:

\begin{conjecture}
	For any graph $G$ with nonorientable genus $g$ on a surface $\Sigma$, $G$ can be embedded on $\leq f(g)$ pages such that for any face $F$ on $\Sigma - G$, the number of monochromatic paths is bounded by some $h(g)$. 
\end{conjecture}

For nonorientable surfaces, this is more complicated. \textcite{heathEmbeddingPlanarGraphs1984} did not sufficiently prove the case for non-orientable graphs. \textcite{nakamotoBookEmbeddingProjectiveplanar2015} showed that every projective-planar graph can be embedded in $9$ pages, which was improved to 6 with a more complex proof. However, we want to prove a book-embedding for all nonorientable surfaces. 

We want to show the following:
\begin{conjecture}
	Let $G$ be a graph with a 2-cell embedding on a non-orientable surface $\Sigma$ of genus $g$. Then $G$ can be embedded in $O(g)$ pages.
\end{conjecture}

For the case that $g = 1$, then $G$ can be embedded in 6 pages, from \textcite{ozekiBookEmbeddingGraphs2019}. However, it is not known for higher $g$, and in fact the case when $g = 2$ (Klein-Bottle graphs) was stated to be an open problem.
