\chapter{Treewidth}\label{chap:treewidth}
This chapter discusses treewidth and book-embeddings. \cref{sec:treewidth} defines treewidth and discusses its importance in structural graph theory. Additionally, we discuss a proof from \textcite{ganleyPagenumberTrees2001}. They show that graphs of treewidth $k$ has a book-embedding in $k + 1$ pages.
