\section{Path-width}\label{sec:Pathwidth}
Similar to treewidth, the pathwidth of a graph \(G\) defines how similar $G$ is from a path.

A path-decomposition of a graph \(G\) is defined as a path $P$ of some length $n$ with associated \textit{bags} \(\lbrace B_i : 1 \leq i \leq n \rbrace\) such that:
\begin{itemize}
	\item $\bigcup_{1 \leq i \leq n} B_i = V(G)$.
	\item For all \(v \in V(G)\), the subset of vertices \(\left\lbrace x \in V(P): v \in B_x \right\rbrace\) induces a connected subpath in \(V(P)\).
	\item For all edges \(vw \in E(G)\), there exists a bag \(B_x\) such that both \(v\) and \(w\) are in \(B_x\).
\end{itemize}

Typically, $P$ is suppressed.
If a graph $G$ has a path-decomposition \({(B_i)}_i\), then $G$ has a tree-decomposition \(\left(P,{(B_i)}_i\right)\). Therefore,
\begin{equation*}
	\pw(G) \geq \tw(G).
\end{equation*}
The pathwidth of \(G\) is the largest pathwidth over all connected components.

A graph \(G\) is a \textit{caterpillar} if \(G\) is a tree and $G$ has a path \(P\) where every vertex not in $P$ is adjacent to a vertex on the path \(P\). Alternatively, a tree \(G\) is a caterpillar if removing every leaf yields a path. This path is called the \textit{central path}.
\begin{proposition}
	A graph $G$ has pathwidth at most 1 if and only if every connected component of $G$ is a caterpillar.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
	$\Leftarrow$ Suppose \(G\) is a caterpillar.
	Denote \(P =\left( v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n\right)\) as the central path. The leaves of vertex \(p_i\) are denoted as \(v_{i, 1}, v_{i, 2} \dots, v_{i, k}\). Define the bags as
	\begin{equation*}
		(v_{1, 1}, v_1), (v_{1, 2}, v_1) ,\ldots ,(v_{1, j}, v_1),  (v_1, v_2), (v_{2, 1}, v_2), (v_{2,2}, v_2,),\ldots ,(v_{n-1}, v_n), (v_{n,1}, v_n), (v_{n,2}, v_n) .
	\end{equation*}
	Each leaf appears once and each vertex on the central path is on a subpath of the path. Every edge is in one bag. Therefore, the pathwidth of \(G\) is 1. If every component of $G$ is a caterpillar, then repeat for every component.

	$\Rightarrow$ Suppose \(G\) has pathwidth 1. Then $G$ is a tree, because $G$ having pathwidth 1 implies $G$ has treewidth 1. Then for each connected component of \(G\), choose a vertex \(v\) in \(B_1\) and a vertex \(w\) in \(B_n\), the final bag, and look at a path from \(v\) to \(w\). This path goes through every bag. Every vertex not on this path is adjacent to a vertex on this path. Therefore $G$ is a caterpillar. 
	
	An example of a caterpillar is in \cref{fig:caterpillar}.

\begin{example}
	Recall that $K_n$ is the complete graph on $n$ vertices. It holds that \(\pw(K_n) = \tw(K_n) = n - 1\).
\end{example}
\begin{proof}
	The pathwidth of \(K_n\) is at least the treewidth of \(K_n\). But the pathwidth is at most \(n- 1\) (where all the vertices are in the same bag), but the treewidth of \(K_n\) is \(n - 1\). Therefore, \(\pw(K_n) = n - 1\).
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}
	The pathwidth of a tree \(T\) is \(\min_{P \subseteq T} \left\lbrace 1 + \pw(T - V(P))\right\rbrace \) where \(P\) is a path.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}[Proof]
	Show \(\pw(T) \leq 1 + \pw(T - V(P))\) for all $P$. If \(P\) is a path in \(T\) with vertices \(v_1, v_2, \ldots v_i\), then consider the subtrees hanging off \(v_i\) for all \(i\). \(T - V(P)\) will have a path-decomposition of width $\pw(T - P)$. Order each connected component such that they appear in the order of their parents on the paths. Then adding \(v_i\) to the bags of subtrees connected to \(v_i\), and the bag \((v_i, v_{i+1})\) between the subtrees \(v_i\) and \(v_{i + 1}\) will yield a path-decomposition of width \(1 + \pw(T - V(P))\).

	Show there exists $P$ such that \(\pw(T) \geq 1 + \pw(T - V(P))\). Proceed by construction. Let \(B_1, \ldots B_n\) be a path-decomposition of \(T\). Let \(x\) live in bag \(B_1\) and \(y\) live in bag \(B_n\), the final bag. Then let \(P\) be the unique path from \(x\) to \(y\). Then \(P\) traverses through every bag in the path-decomposition. Then \(\pw(T) \geq 1 + \pw(T - P)\) by adding every parent to the bag of each component. 
\end{proof}
