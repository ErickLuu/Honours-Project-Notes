\chapter{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}
Structural graph theory is a fundamental topic in graph theory. Many results from structural graph theory decompose graphs, or families of graphs, into smaller graphs with bounded parameters. One of the most important theorems in structural graph theory is Robertson and Seymour's Graph Minor Theorem \cite{robertsonGraphMinorsXX2004} which states that every proper minor-closed graph family is characterised by a finite set of forbidden minors.

\section{Background to Graph Theory}
This section is a brief overview of some concepts in topological graph theory and structural graph theory. We will discuss these concepts in further detail throughout the report. We also introduce some of the important theorems related to these concepts to discuss the initial motivation to studying these concepts in the first place.
