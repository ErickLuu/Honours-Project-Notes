\chapter{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}
Structural graph theory is a fundamental topic in graph theory. Many results from structural graph theory decompose graphs, or families of graphs, into smaller graphs with bounded parameters. One of the most important theorems in structural graph theory is Robertson and Seymour's Graph Minor Theorem \cite{robertsonGraphMinorsXX2004} which states that every proper minor-closed graph family is characterised by a finite set of forbidden minors.
A \textit{book-embedding} of a graph $G$ arranges the vertices of $G$ on the ``spine'' of a book and arranges the edges of $G$ on ``pages'' of a book. The \textit{pagenumber} of a graph \(G\) is the minimum number of pages necessary in a book-embedding of \(G\). The concept of the \textit{pagenumber} of a graph was introduced by Ollmann \cite{ollmannBookThicknessVarious1973} in the context of VLSI design and integrated circuitry. 
The driving question of this report is the following:
\begin{conjecture}\label{conj:bded_had_pn}
	Suppose a graph $G$ is $K_t$-minor-free. Then the pagenumber of \(G\) is bounded by a function of \(t\).
\end{conjecture}
This report lays out the current literature related to this question. We use a result in one of the papers of the Graph Minor Theorem, by \textcite{robertsonGraphMinorsXVI2003}. The result we use is the Graph Minor Structure Theorem, which coarsely describes $K_t$-minor free graphs.
In her PhD thesis, \textcite{Blankenship-PhD03} claimed to prove \cref{conj:bded_had_pn}. However, this result has not been published and has not been independently verified. We aim to fill this gap in knowledge.

We have good reason to believe \cref{conj:bded_had_pn} is true. Firstly, it was shown by \textcite{yannakakisEmbeddingPlanarGraphs1989} that all planar graphs need at most 4 pages. It was then shown by \textcite{malitzGenusGraphsHave1994} that all graphs of Euler genus $g$ have pagenumber $O(\sqrt{g})$. We also have that graphs with bounded treewidth have bounded pagenumber, from \textcite{ganleyPagenumberTrees2001} and \textcite{dujmovicGraphTreewidthGeometric2007}.
\section{Our proof attempt}
We aim to solve this question using the Graph Minor Structure Theorem \cite{robertsonGraphMinorsXVI2003}, which describes the structure of graphs that do not contain a \(K_t\) minor.
Robertson and Seymour showed that graphs with no \(K_t\) minor can be built from smaller building blocks. This is a rough overview of the building blocks. We first start with a graph \(G\) embedded on a genus \(g\) surface. Then we add on \(p\) \textit{vortices} to \(G\), with \textit{pathwidth} at most \(k\). Then we add on \(a\) \textit{apex vertices} to \(G\). We say that \(G\) is \((g, p, k, a)\)-\textit{almost embeddable}. Robertson and Seymour \cite{robertsonGraphMinorsXVI2003} proved that all graphs with no \(K_t\) minor has a \textit{tree-decomposition} where every \textit{torso} is a \((g, p, k, a)\) almost-embeddable graph, with \((g, p, k, a)\) bounded by a function of \(t\).
We have some useful results that can be paired with the Graph Minor Structure Theorem to prove \cref{conj:bded_had_pn}.
\begin{itemize}
	\item From \textcite{heathPagenumberGenusGraphs1992}, all graphs of bounded genus have bounded pagenumber.
	\item From \textcite{ganleyPagenumberTrees2001}, and \textcite{dujmovicGraphTreewidthGeometric2007}, all graphs of bounded treewidth have bounded pagenumber.
	\item From \textcite{hickingbothamStackNumberCliqueSum2023}, if a graph \(G\) has a \textit{tree-decomposition} where every \textit{torso} has bounded pagenumber, then \(G\) has bounded pagenumber.
\end{itemize}
These results individually show that the constituent ingredients of the GMST have bounded pagenumber. What this report aims to do is to combine these proofs together to show that the pagenumber is bounded for all $K_t$-minor free graphs.
The biggest hurdle is showing that adding vortices on surfaces will not blow up the pagenumber. To address this issue, we introduce a new concept when considering faces on surfaces with a fixed book-embedding. This is referred to in the report as \textit{monochromatic paths}.
