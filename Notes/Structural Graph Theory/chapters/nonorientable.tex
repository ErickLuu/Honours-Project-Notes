\chapter{Graphs embedded on nonorientable surfaces}\label{chap:nonorientable}

This chapter discusses book-embeddings of graphs on an orientable surface. First, a paper by \textcite{nakamotoBookEmbeddingProjectiveplanar2015} discusses a book-embedding of projective-planar graphs. Then there is a discussion of some techniques that can be used to prove that all Klein bottle graphs can be embedded on a bounded number of pages. Finally, we conjecture that graphs embedded on a non-orientable surface have bounded pagenumber. This conjecture is strengthened so that every face has a bounded number of monochromatic paths. Then this strengthened conjecture is enough to prove \cref{conj:bded_had_pn}.
