\section{Pagenumber of projective-planar graphs}
In the non-orientable case, Heath and Istrail claim to prove the below conjecture.
\begin{conjecture}\label{lem:planar_nonplanar_nonorientable}
	Suppose a graph \(G\) has a planar-nonplanar decomposition \((G_P, E_N)\) on a non-orientable surface \(\Sigma\) of genus $g$. Then \(G\) can be embedded on at most \(9g - 1\) pages.
\end{conjecture}
However, the proof given in their paper only holds in the case when the graph $G_P$ is a cycle, or with a bounded number of chords in the cycle. \textcite{nakamotoBookEmbeddingProjectiveplanar2015} also notices this error and proves the following theorem.

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:proj_planar_graphs_9pages}
	Every graph embedded on the projective plane has a book-embedding with 9 pages.
\end{theorem}.
