\section{Graph Minor Structure Theorem}\label{sec:Kt_Minor_Free}
In this section, we discuss a coarse characterisation of \(K_t\)-minor free graphs.\ \textcite{robertsonGraphMinorsXVII1999} proved a rough characterisation of all \(K_t\)-minor free graphs. 

Each graph that is $K_t$-minor-free can be constructed from the following ingredients.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Graphs of bounded Euler genus
	\item Sets of apex vertices
	\item Graphs of bounded treewidth
	\item Sets of vortices on graphs.
\end{itemize}
It was shown by \textcite{robertsonGraphMinorsXVII1999} that every \(K_t\)-minor free graph can be built up from smaller graphs with the above ingredients.

\subsection{Graphs of bounded Euler genus}

Graphs which can be embedded on a surface of Euler genus $g$ are $K_t$ minor-free, where \(t > \sqrt{6g} + 4\). This comes from \cref{thm:bounded_genus_kt_free}. 

\subsection{Apex sets}\label{sssec:Apex_Vertices}
Let $G$ be a graph. A set of vertices $A \subseteq V(G)$ is an apex set if $G - A$ has some bounded parameter. Common parameters are planarity or bounded genus. 
\begin{theorem}
	Let $G$ be a graph. If \(G\) is \(K_{t + 1}\)-minor free, then for any vertex $a \in V(G)$, $G - a$ is \(K_t\)- minor free. 
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	We shall prove the contrapositive. Suppose \(G\) has a \(K_{t + 1}\) minor. Then \(K_{t + 1}\) has a model in \(G\) and denote the model function as \(\rho\). Now let \(v\) be the vertex in \(K_{t + 1}\) such that \(\rho(v)\) contains \(a\). Then delete \(v\) from \(K_{t + 1}\) to form $K_t$. \(K_t\) is a minor of \(G - \rho(v)\). But \(G - \rho(v)\) is a minor of \(G - a\), as \(G - \rho(v)\) does not contain \(a\). So \(G - a\) has a \(K_t\) minor. 
\end{proof}
\subsection{Clique-sums}\label{sssec:Clique_Sums}
The \textit{\(k\)-clique-sum} of two graphs \(G\) and \(H\) is a new graph formed from both $G$ and $H$ by identifying two cliques together. The clique-sum of $G$ and $H$ is \(G \oplus_k H\), and is defined as follows. Find cliques in \(G\) and \(H\), \(C_G\) and \(C_H\) respectively, such that both \(C_G\) and \(C_H\) have size \(k\). Identify the vertices in \(C_G\) and \(C_H\) to glue \(G\) and \(H\) together, and possibly delete edges in $C_G$. An illustration can be found in \cref{fig:clique-sum}.

	\label{fig:clique-sum}
\end{figure}


\begin{lemma}
	Let $t$ be an integer $\geq 1$. Let $G_1, G_2$ be two graphs with treewidth $t$. Then for all $k \leq t + 1$, $G_1 \oplus_k G_2$ has treewidth $t$. 
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	Suppose $C = V(G_1) \cap V(G_2)$ be the clique that is glued over, where $|C| = k$. Let $(B_x: x \in T_1)$ be a tree-decomposition of $G_1$ of minimum width. Let $(B_x : x \in T_2)$ be a tree-decomposition of $G_2$ of minimum width. Then $C$ must appear in some bag $A_x$ and $B_y$ by \cref{lem:clique}. Let $T = T_1 \sqcup T_2$. Add a new node $u$ to $T$ and let $B_u = C$. Then add edges $ux, uy$ to $E(T)$ to form a new tree. Every vertex not in $C$ has a subtree in $T$. If $v \in C$, then the induced subgraph in $T$ is the graph $T_1(v) \cup T_2(v) \cup u$ which is a subtree. Finally, every edge in $G_1 \cup G_2$ remains in $T$. Therefore, $T$ is a tree-decomposition of $G_1 \oplus_k G_2$. The size of each bag in $T$ is still at most $t + 1$, so the treewidth of $G_1 \oplus_k G_2 \leq t$.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
	Let $t$ be an integer $\geq 1$. Suppose $G$ and $H$ are graphs which are $K_t$-minor-free. Then $G \oplus_k H$ is $K_{t}$-minor free. 
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	Let $C = V(G) \cap V(H)$ be the clique that is being pasted over. As $G$ and $H$ are $K_t$-minor free, then $|C| \leq k - 1$. Suppose $G \oplus_k H$ is not $K_t$-minor free. Then there exists a model $\rho: V(K_t) \rightarrow G\oplus_k H$ of $K_t$ in $G \oplus_k H$. $\rho$ cannot have its image only in $G$ or only in $H$. Suppose $\rho(x) \cap V(G) \neq \emptyset$ for all $x \in K_t$. Then contract the subgraphs which also contain vertices in $H$ to only have vertices in $G$. Then this is a $K_t$ model in $G$, which is a contradiction. However, there cannot also be vertices $x, y \in V(K_t)$ where $\rho(x)$ is in $G - C$ and $\rho(y)$ is in $H - C$ as these subgraphs are disconnected. Therefore, if $\rho(x)$ is in $G - C$, then all subgraphs have a vertex in $G$. But this means that $\rho$ cannot exist, as the two possibilities are mutually exclusive. Therefore, $\rho$ cannot exist. 
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}\label{corr:clique_sum_genus}
	If \(G\) is the clique-sum of Euler genus \(g\) graphs, then \(G\) is \(K_{\lceil \sqrt{6g} + 5 \rceil}\)-minor-free.
\end{corollary}
The reverse does not hold. 
\begin{lemma}
	There exists graphs $G$ such that \(G\) has arbitrarily large genus, but $G$ is \(K_{6}\)-minor-free.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
	Consider $n$ copies of $K_5$ and identify one vertex in every $K_5$ to a single vertex $v$ to form $G$. Then $G$ is $K_6$-minor free. However, from \cref{thm:additivity_genus}, $G$ has genus $n$. Thus, $G$ has unbounded genus. 
\end{proof}

\subsubsection{Torsos and adhesion}\label{sssec:Torsos and Adhesion}
Given a graph \(G\) and a tree-decomposition \(\tree\), the \textit{torso} of a bag \(B_x\) of \(T\) is the graph \(G\langle B_x \rangle\), with vertex set $B_x$ and edge set defined as follows: \(vw\) is an edge in \(G\langle B_x \rangle\) if and only if \(v,w \in B_x \cap B_y\), where \(y\) is any neighbour of \(x\) in \(T\). The set \(B_x \cap B_y\) for all neighbours \(y\) of \(x\) in \(T\) is a clique in \(G\langle B_x \rangle\).
The \textit{adhesion set} is the set \(B_x \cap B_y\). 
The \textit{adhesion} of a tree is defined as \(\max(|B_x \cap B_y|)\) where \(xy\) is an edge in \(T\).

Given \(G\) and a tree-decomposition \(\tree\), \(G\) is a clique-sum of the torsos \(G\langle B_x \rangle\) where the size of the cliques that we paste over is at most the adhesion of $\tree$. This holds for any arbitrary tree-decomposition.
We will discuss decomposing graphs in the language of tree-decompositions, rather than clique-sums. This is because we can discuss the structure of the tree-decomposition.

\subsection{Vortices}\label{sssec:vortices}
Let \(G\) be embedded on a surface \(\Sigma\), and let \(F\) be a face on \(G\). A disc $D$ is \textit{$G$-clean} if $D$ is a subset of some $F$ and $G \cap D$ is a tuple of vertices \(\Lambda = (x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_b)\). The ordering of $\Lambda$ is around the boundary of $D$. 
\par
Let $G$ be a graph embedded on $\Sigma$. Let $D$ be a $G$-clean disc with $G \cap D = \Lambda = (x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_b)$. A \textit{$D$-vortex} is a graph $H$ such that $V(G) \cap V(H) = \Lambda$ and there is a \textit{path-decomposition} of \(H\) of bags \(B_1, B_2, \ldots B_b\) such that \(x_i \in B_i\) for all \(i\).
\par
The reason why vortices are important are because of graphs like \cref{fig:tenniscourt}. This graph $G_n$ is one where vortices are needed as an essential ingredient. $G_n$ is $K_8$-minor free. However, $G_n$ has around $\frac{n}{3}$ $K_{3,3}$ copies, so has genus around $\frac{2n}{3}$. As there is an $n \times n$ grid minor, $G$ has treewidth at least $n$. As $G$ can be arbitrarily large, the number of apex vertices to remove to bound the treewidth and genus is arbitrarily large. However, there is a decomposition of $G_n$ into two graphs $G_0$ and $G_1$ where $G_0$ can be embedded on a surface and $G_1$ is a vortex on $G_0$ with path-width 6.

\subsection{Robertson-Seymour Graph Minor Structure Theorem}\label{ssec:Robertson_Seymour_Graph_Structure}
Given integers \(g, p, a \geq 0\), \(k \geq 1\), a graph \(G\) is \((g, p, k, a)\)- almost-embeddable if there exists an \(A \subseteq V(G)\) with \(|A| \leq a\), and there exists subgraphs \(G_0, G_1, \ldots,  G_{p'}\) of \(G\) such that:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \(G - A = G_0 \cup G_1 \cup G_2 \cup \ldots \cup G_{p'}\),
	\item \(p' \leq p\),
	\item there is an embedding of \(G_0\) onto a surface \(\Sigma\) of genus \(\leq g\),
	\item there exists pairwise disjoint \(G_0\)-clean discs \(D_1, D_2, \ldots, D_{p'}\) in \(\Sigma\),
	\item \(G_i\) is a \(D_i\)-vortex of width at most \(k\).
\end{itemize}

\begin{theorem}[Graph Minor Structure Theorem \cite{robertsonGraphMinorsXVI2003}]\label{thm:gmst}
	For all \(t\), there exists \(g, p, a \geq 0\) and \(k, \ell \geq 1\) such that every \(K_t\)-minor-free graph has a tree-decomposition of adhesion \(\leq \ell\) and each torso is \((g, p, k, a)\)-almost-embeddable. The  family of graphs which have tree-decomposition of adhesion $\leq \ell$ with torsos $(g, p, k, a)$-almost-embeddable is \(\mathcal{G}(g, p, k, a)\). Adhesion $\ell$ is implied. 
\end{theorem}
There exists a function \(t(g, p, k, a)\) such that if a graph has a tree-decomposition of adhesion \(\leq \ell\) and each torso is \((g, p, k, a)\)-almost embeddable, then \(G\) has no \(K_t\) minor.\ \textcite{joretCompleteGraphMinors2013} found that
\begin{theorem}[\textcite{joretCompleteGraphMinors2013}]\label{thm:graph_structure_bound_theorem}
	For all graphs \(G \in \mathcal{G}(g, p, k, a)\),
	\(\had(G) \leq a + 48(k + 1)\sqrt{g + p} + \sqrt{6g} + 5\). Moreover, there exists an integer \(n \geq a + 1 4 k\sqrt{p + g}\) such that \(K_n\) is a minor of some graph in \(\mathcal{G}(g, p, k, a)\).
\end{theorem}

\section{Graph Minor Theorem}\label{sec:Graph Minor Theorem}
We move on to one of the most important and deepest theorems in graph theory, the Graph Minor Theorem. This was proven in a series of 23 papers by Robertson and Seymour, from 1983 to 2004. As part of the proof, the Graph Minor Structure Theorem was developed. 
\begin{theorem}[Graph Minor Theorem \cite{robertsonGraphMinorsXX2004}]
	Every infinite family of graphs contains two distinct graphs \(G\) and \(H\) such that \(H\) is a minor of \(G\).
\end{theorem}
Let $\mathcal{F}$ be a minor-closed graph family. A graph $H$ is a \textit{minimal forbidden minor} of $\mathcal{F}$ if every graph $G$ in $\mathcal{F}$ is $H$-minor-free and every proper minor $H'$ of $H$ (meaning $H'$ is not $H$) is in $\mathcal{F}$. 
The Graph Minor Theorem is equivalent to the statement:
\begin{theorem}
	Every minor-closed graph family $\mathcal{F}$ is characterised by a finite set of minimal forbidden minors $\mathcal{H}$. A graph $G$ is in $\mathcal{F}$ if and only if $G$ is $\mathcal{H}$-minor free.
\end{theorem}
Importantly, graphs of bounded genus can be characterised as a set of forbidden minors. The family of graphs that can be embedded on a fixed surface $\sigma$ is minor-closed. 
For planar graphs, the two minimal forbidden minors are \(K_5\) and \(K_{3,3}\), from \textcite{wagnerUeberEigenschaftEbenen1937}. 
The family of graphs that can be embedded on a torus are the toroidal graphs. There are at least 17,523 graphs which are forbidden minors, with a database maintained by \textcite{myrvoldLargeSetTorus2018}. $K_7$ is a toroidal graph but $K_8$ is not. An example of an embedding of $K_7$ on a torus is in \cref{fig:k7_on_torus}.

\begin{figure}[h!]

	\includesvg[width = 0.8\textwidth]{figures/k7 on torus.svg}
	\caption{Figure of $K_7$ embedded on a torus}\label{fig:k7_on_torus}
\end{figure}

\begin{lemma}
	$K_8$ is not embeddable on the torus.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	A torus has genus 2. By Euler's equation, if a graph $G$ is embedded on a torus, then $|V(G)| - |E(G)| + |F(G)| = 2 - 2 = 0$, where $|F(G)|$ counts the number of faces on the surface. Every face bounds at least three vertices and every edge touches two faces. Therefore, $|F(G)| \leq 2|E(G)|/3$. Suppose $K_8$ is embeddable on the torus. Then $|V(G)| = 8$ and $|E(G)| = 28$. Therefore, $|F(G)| = 20$. But $|F(G)| \leq 2 (28)/3 \leq 19$. Therefore, $K_8$ is not embeddable on the torus by contradiction.
\end{proof}

A graph $G$ is \textit{linkless} if $G$ has an embedding in $\mathbb{R}^3$ such that no two cycles are linked. If no embedding of $G$ has this property, then $G$ is \textit{inherently linked}. The family of linkless graphs is minor-closed. If $G$ is linkless, then contracting any edge maintains the linkless property. There are only seven minimal forbidden minors of linkless graphs, including $K_6$ and the Petersen graph, from \textcite{robertsonSachsLinklessEmbedding1995}. 

A graph $G$ is \textit{knotless} if $G$ can be embedded in $\mathbb{R}^3$ such that every cycle of $G$ is a simple knot. $G$ is \textit{inherently knotted} if this is not the case.\ \textcite{conwayKnotsLinksSpatial1983} showed that $K_7$ is inherently knotted. The family of knotless graphs is also minor-closed, since contracting any edge preserves the knotless property. $K_7$ is an example of a minimal forbidden minor. It was found by \textcite{conwayKnotsLinksSpatial1983} and \textcite{foisyIntrinsicallyKnottedGraphs2002,foisyNewlyRecognizedIntrinsically2003} that there exists at least three minimal minors, but it is unknown how many there really are.
