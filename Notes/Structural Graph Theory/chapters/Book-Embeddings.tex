\chapter{Book-Embeddings and treewidth}\label{chap:book-embeddings}

This chapter explores book-embeddings in more detail and proves many important results. The two papers we go through is an unpublished paper by \textcite{hickingbothamStackNumberCliqueSum2023} and \textcite{ganleyPagenumberTrees2001}. These papers involve book-embeddings of graphs with a tree-decomposition.
