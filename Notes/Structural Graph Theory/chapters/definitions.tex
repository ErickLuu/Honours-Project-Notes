\section{Basic definitions}\label{sec: Basic definitions}
A graph $G$ consists of a vertex set $V(G)$ and an edge set $E(G)$. $E(G)$ contains subsets of $V(G)$ with two elements. In this paper, all graphs are simple, meaning that all edges join two distinct vertices and there is at most one edge between any two vertices. Furthermore, all graphs $G$ are finite, so $|V(G)| < \infty$. 
Let $G$ be a graph. A \textit{subgraph} $H$ in $G$ is a graph with vertex set $V(H) \subseteq V(G)$ and edge set $E(H)$ with the property that if $vw$ is an edge in $E(H)$, then $vw$ is an edge in $E(G)$.
Let $G$ be a graph and let $S$ be a non-empty subset of the vertex set of $G$. The \textit{induced subgraph} of $S$ in $G$ is the graph $G[S]$ with vertex set $S$ and edge set containing precisely all edges in $G$ incident to two vertices in $S$. Removing a set of vertices $S \subseteq V(G)$ from $G$ forms the induced subgraph $G - S := G[V(G) - S]$. 
$H$ is a \textit{spanning subgraph} of $G$ if $H$ is a subgraph of $G$ and $V(H) = V(G)$. 
Let $G$ be a graph. The neighborhood of a set of vertices $A \subset V(G)$ is defined to be all vertices that are adjacent to a vertex in $A$ and not in $A$ and is denoted as $N_G(A)$. 

\begin{itemize}
	\item A \textit{path} in a graph \(G\) is a sequence of edges \(e_1, e_2, \ldots, e_{\ell- 1}\) which join a sequence of vertices \(v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_{\ell}\) such that \(e_i = v_i v_{i + 1}\), and all the vertices are distinct.
	\item A \textit{cycle} \(C\) in a graph \(G\) is a sequence of edges \(e_1, e_2, \ldots, e_{\ell}\) which join a sequence of distinct vertices \(v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_{\ell}\) such that \(e_i = v_i v_{i + 1}\) for \(1 \leq i \leq \ell - 1\) and \(e_\ell = v_\ell v_1\).
	\item A \textit{Hamiltonian cycle} in a graph \(G\) is a cycle \(C\) such that all the vertices in \(G\) appear in \(C\). If a graph $G$ has a Hamiltonian cycle, then $G$ is a Hamiltonian graph. 
\end{itemize}

A graph $G$ is \textit{connected} if between any two distinct vertices $x$ and $y$ there exists a path which starts and ends at $x$ and $y$. 
A connected graph \(G\) is \textit{\(k\)-connected} if \(G\) has more than \(k\) vertices and for any vertex set $S \subseteq V(G)$ where $|S| \leq k - 1$ it holds that $G - S$ is connected. $2$-connected graphs are called \textit{biconnected} graphs. 

Throughout this report, the set $\lbrace 1\ldots n \rbrace$ is notated as $[n]$. 
A graph \(G\) is \(k\)-colourable if there exists a function \(f: V(G) \rightarrow [k]\) such that if $f(v) = f(w)$, then $v$ and $w$ do not share an edge. The \textit{chromatic number} \(\chi(G)\) is the smallest \(k\) such that \(G\) is \(k\)-colourable.

\subsection{Menger's theorem}
Menger's theorem \cite{mengerZurAllgemeinenKurventheorie1927} is an important theorem which is used throughout the report.
Let \(G\) be a graph and \(A, B \subseteq V(G)\). An \(AB\)-path is a path in \(G\) which starts in \(A\) and ends in \(B\) with no internal vertices in \(A \cup B\). An \(AB\)-connector is a set of disjoint \(AB\)-paths. An \(AB\)-separator is a set \(S \subseteq V(G)\) such that \(G - S\) contains no \(AB\)-path. Then:
\begin{theorem}[Menger's theorem]\label{thm:Menger}
	Let $G$ be a graph and let $A, B \subseteq V(G)$. Then the size of the smallest \(AB\)-separator of \(G\) is equal to the size of the largest \(AB\)-connector.
\end{theorem}
Now take two distinct vertices \(x, y\). Let \(A = N_G(x) \cup \{x\} \) and \(B = N_G(y) \cup \{y\} \). Then \cref{thm:Menger} implies that:
\begin{theorem}[Menger's theorem, vertex-connectivity version]\label{thm:Menger_Vertex}
	A graph \(G\) is \(k\)-connected if and only if for any two distinct vertices, there are at least \(k\) internally disjoint paths between the two vertices.
\end{theorem}
As a corollary, all Hamiltonian graphs are biconnected. For any two distinct vertices in a Hamiltonian graph, there are two internally disjoint paths by traversing the Hamiltonian cycle.

\section{Planar graphs}\label{sec:Planar graphs}
A graph \(G\) is \textit{planar} if \(G\) can be drawn in the Euclidean plane \( \mathbb{R}^2 \) such that no two edges cross. A drawing of $G$ in $\mathbb{R}^2$ is referred to as an \textit{embedding} of $G$ in $\mathbb{R}^2$. If \(G\) is embedded in \(\mathbb{R}^2 \), then we can remove $G$ from $\mathbb{R}^2$. The connected components in $\mathbb{R}^2 - G$ are called \textit{faces}. The \textit{outerface} is the unbounded face in $\mathbb{R}^2$, meaning that the outerface goes to infinity. The \textit{internal faces} of $G$ are all the faces which are not the outerface. A set of vertices $S$ in $V(G)$ \textit{lie} on a face $F$, or \textit{bound} $F$ if $S$ is in the closure of $F$. A set of edges $T$ in $V(G)$ also bound a face $F$ if $T$ is in the closure of $F$. If an edge $e$ bounds a face $F$, then $e$ \textit{touches} $F$. \(G\) is \textit{outerplanar} if \(G\) is planar and there exists an embedding such that all vertices in \(G\) lie on the outerface.
Let \(F(G)\) be the set of faces of \(G\) embedded on \(\mathbb{R}^2\). Then we have that:
\begin{theorem}[Euler's formula]\label{thm:Euler_planar}
	For all connected graphs $G$,
	\begin{equation}
		|V(G)| - |E(G)| + |F(G)| = 2
	\end{equation}
\end{theorem}

We can use this result to bound the number of edges in an outerplanar graph.
\begin{theorem}\label{thm:outerplanar_bound}
	If \(G\) is outerplanar with \(n\) vertices and \(m\) edges, then \(m \leq 2n - 3\).
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
	Suppose \(G\) is \textit{maximal outerplanar}, meaning adding any edge will break the outerplanar property. Let there be \(f\) internal faces in $G$. Then the outerface has \(n\) edges on the boundary as every vertex in $G$ is on the boundary of the outerface. Each internal face will have exactly \(3\) edges on the boundary. However, each edge is touching exactly two distinct faces. By counting the number of edges on every face,
	\begin{equation*}
		3 f + n = 2m.
	\end{equation*}
	Combining with \cref{thm:Euler_planar},
	\begin{equation*}
		n - m + (f + 1) = 2
	\end{equation*}
	we have, after some rearrangment,
	\begin{equation*}
		2n = 3 + m.
	\end{equation*}
	Therefore, \(m = 2n - 3\). Since every outerplanar graph is a spanning subgraph of a maximal planar graph, \(m \leq 2n - 3\).
\end{proof}
\section{Graph minors}\label{sec:Graph Minors}
A graph \(H\) is a \textit{minor} of a graph \(G\) if a graph isomorphic to \(H\) can be obtained from \(G\) by deleting vertices, deleting edges, and \textit{contracting} edges. Let $G$ be a graph and let $uv$ be an edge in $E(G)$. To \textit{contract} \(uv\), we delete both \(u\) and \(v\) and create a new vertex \(w\) with neighbourhood \(N(w) = N_G(u) \cup N_G(v)\). The graph obtained after contracting the edge \(uv\) in $G$ is written as \(G\setminus uv\).
The statement ``\(H\) is a minor of \(G\)'' is written as \(H \leq G\). A graph \(G\) is \textit{\(H\)-minor-free} if $H$ is not a minor of $G$. A family of graphs \(\mathcal{F}\) is \textit{minor-closed} if it holds that when $G$ is in \(\mathcal{F}\) and \(H \leq G\), then $H$ is in \(\mathcal{F}\).
An example of a minor-closed class is the class of planar graphs.
An important class of graph families are the \(K_t\)-minor free graphs. For a graph \(G\), we define \(\had(G)\) to be the largest \(t\) such that \(K_t\) is a minor of \(G\). This is named after Hugo Hadwiger and his most famous conjecture.

\begin{conjecture}[Hadwiger's conjecture]
	For all graphs \(G\), \(\chi(G) \leq \had(G)\)\cite{hadwigerUeberKlassifikationStreckenkomplexe1943}.
\end{conjecture}
Much work has been done on solving Hadwiger's conjecture, with a document by \textcite{seymourHadwigerConjecture2016} on the latest progress. However, it remains unsolved. 
\subsection{Minors and models}
A \textit{model} of a graph \(H\) in a graph \(G\) is a function $\rho$ which assigns to \(H\) vertex-disjoint connected subgraphs of \(G\). If $uv$ is an edge in \(E(H)\), then some edge in \(G\) joins the two subgraphs \(\rho(u)\) and \(\rho(v)\). 

\begin{theorem}
	\(H\) is a model of \(G\) if and only if $H$ is a minor of $G$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
	From \textcite{norinMath599GraphMinors2017}. Suppose \(H\) is a model of \(G\). Then for all \(x\) in \(V(H)\), contract \(\rho(x)\) in \(G\) to a single vertex. This is a well-defined operation as the image $\rho(x)$ is connected and disjoint from all $\rho(y)$ where $y$ is a distinct vertex in $H$. Then delete edges to form \(H\).

	Suppose \(H \leq G\). Use induction to show that \(H\) has a model in \(G\). Suppose \(H\) is obtained from \(G\) by contraction operations only. We can assume this by taking a subgraph of \(G\) if necessary. Let \(uv\) be the first contracted edge and let \(G' := G \setminus uv\). Let \(w\) be the vertex obtained after contracting \(uv\). Then by induction, there is a model \(\rho\) of \(H\) in \(G'\). Then find $x \in V(H)$ such that $w \in V(\rho(x))$. If there is no such $x$, then it is obvious that $\rho$ is a model of $H$ in $G$. Otherwise, 
	delete \(w\) from \(V(\rho(x)) \) and add $u, v$ to $V(\rho(x))$, the edge $uv$, and the edges from $u$ and $v$ to the neighbours in $w$ in $\rho(x)$. Then this is a model of \(H\) in \(G\).
\end{proof}

\section{Book embedding}\label{sec:Book Embedding}
A \textit{book} with \(k\) \textit{pages} consists of \(k\) half-planes glued together on a common boundary. We refer to the boundary as the \textit{spine} and we refer to the individual half-planes as \textit{pages}. In topology, these are referred to as \textit{fans} of half-planes. Books were described by \textcite{persingerSubsetsNbooksE31966,atneosenOnedimensionalNleavedContinua1972} in the 1960s.
A \textit{book-embedding} of a graph \(G\) is an embedding of \(G\) on a book. We place the vertices of \(G\) on the spine, and we place each edge on a single page such that no two edges cross.
The \textit{pagenumber} of a graph \(G\) is the minimum number of pages required to embed \(G\) on a book. This is also referred to as \textit{book-thickness}, or \textit{stack-number}.
\todo{Add picture!}
\par
There is an equivalent combinatorial definition. A \textit{book embedding} of a graph \(G\) is an arrangement of the vertices of \(G\) in a total ordering \(v_1 < v_2 < \cdots < v_n\). We then colour the edges \(E(G)\) such that if there are vertices with ordering \(v_a < v_b < v_c < v_d\) and edges \(v_a v_c\) and \(v_b v_d\) in $E(G)$, then $v_a v_c$ and $v_b v_d$ are assigned different colours.
We refer to the total ordering of \(V(G)\) in the book embedding as \((<)\) or as \((\leq)\). For a book-embedding \((v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_{|G|})\), we refer to the edges \( \left\{ v_1 v_2, v_2 v_3, \ldots, v_{|G| - 1}, v_{|G|}v_{1} \right\} \) as \textit{spine edges}.
We may use a \textit{circular ordering} of the vertices rather than a linear ordering. This means that we order the vertices in a circle rather than on a straight line. The book-embedding of a circular ordering is exactly the same as for a linear ordering, and we can convert between a circular and linear ordering by choosing a vertex to be at the start of the sequence.
Book-embeddings were introduced by \textcite{kainenRecentResultsTopological1974, ollmannBookThicknessVarious1973} in the 1970s. A paper by \textcite{bernhartBookThicknessGraph1979} calculated the book-thickness of complete and bipartite graphs.
\begin{lemma}\label{lem:Pagenumber_1}
	A graph \(G\) has pagenumber at most 1 if and only if \(G\) is an outerplanar graph.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	Suppose $G$ is outerplanar, and embedded in $\mathbb{R}^2$. Then we choose a single vertex $v_0$, and traverse anticlockwise around the outerface to form an ordering. If a vertex $v_i$ appears more than once, then add $v_i$ the first time we see it in the traversal and no other times. Then this is a one-page book embedding, as if we have that $v_a < v_b < v_c < v_d$ and edges $v_a v_c$, $v_b v_d$ in $G$, then $v_a v_c$ or $v_b v_d$ have to lie on the outerface, which breaks the condition that $G$ is outerplanar. This is because either $v_b$ or $v_c$ is not on the outerface If $G$ has a $1$-page book-embedding, then embedding the page in $\mathbb{R}^2$ through the inclusion map is an outerplanar embedding of $G$. 
\end{proof}
\begin{lemma}\label{lem:Pagenumber_2}
	A graph \(G\) has pagenumber at most 2 if and only if \(G\) is a subgraph of a planar graph with a Hamiltonian cycle.
\end{lemma}
Suppose $G$ is a subgraph of a planar graph $G'$ with a Hamiltonian cycle $C$. By the Jordan curve theorem, $\mathbb{R}^2 - C$ has two connected components $F_1$ and $F_2$. Choose a vertex $x_0$ and order the vertices with respect to the Hamiltonian cycle $C$ where $x_0$ is the first vertex. Give edges on $C$ colour $1$. For all edges which are a chord in $F_1$, give these edges colour $1$. For all edges which are a chord in $F_2$, give these edges colour $2$. This is a book-embedding of $G'$ on two pages. 
\todo{define chords on faces}
\par
Suppose $G$ has pagenumber $2$, and embedded in a book with two pages. Add all remaining spine edges to one of the pages. Then embed the two pages in $\mathbb{R}^2$ through the homeomorphism of two pages to $\mathbb{R}^2$. Then this is a planar graph with a Hamiltonian cycle, so $G$ is a subgraph of a graph with a Hamiltonian cycle.
\subsection{Properties of pagenumbers}\label{ssec:Related_Properties}
\begin{lemma}[Bound on number of edges, from \textcite{bernhartBookThicknessGraph1979}]\label{lem:Edge_Bound}
	If an \(n\)-vertex graph \(G\) has \(\pn(G) = k\), then \(G\) has at most \(n + k(n-3)\) edges.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	Given a vertex ordering \(v_1 \leq v_2 \leq \cdots \leq v_n\), we have that the spine edges \(v_i v_{i + 1}\), \(v_1 v_n\)  can appear on any page. Furthermore we have there are at most \(n-3\) non outer-cycle edges on each page as the maximum number of edges in an outerplanar graph is \(2n - 3\) from \cref{thm:outerplanar_bound}, but we remove the outer cycle (with \(n\) edges on the cycle) to have at most \(n-3\) edges on each page. Therefore, \(m\), the number of edges, satisfies \(m \leq n + k (n - 3)\).
\end{proof}
\begin{theorem}[\cite{bernhartBookThicknessGraph1979}]\label{thm:Pagenumber_Complete_Graph}
	$\pn(K_n) = \lceil \frac{n}{2} \rceil$ when $n \geq 4$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	To show $\leq$, arrange the vertices in any circular ordering, and colour the edges in a zig-zag spanning path. As an example, we refer to \cref{fig:k8 coloured with colours} to show what zig-zagging pattern we are referring to. We rotate this pattern $\lceil n/2 \rceil$ times. To show equality, we use \cref{lem:Edge_Bound}.
	\par
	To show $\geq$, we use \cref{lem:Edge_Bound} to prove the other direction. We have that \(K_n\) has \(n\) vertices and \(\binom{n}{2}\) edges. Then \(\pn(K_n) \geq \frac{\binom{n}{2} - n}{n - 3} = \frac{n}{2}\) when \(n \geq 4\), from the lemma. As \(\pn(K_n)\) is an integer, we take the ceiling of \(\frac{n}{2}\). This concludes the equality.
\end{proof}
\begin{figure}[ht]
	\caption{Circular embedding of \(K_8\) with 4 colours, the minimum possible.}
	\centering
	\input{figures/k8-withcolouring}\label{fig:k8 coloured with colours}
\end{figure}

This is an upper bound of any graph \(G\) with \(n\) vertices.
Therefore for any graph \(G\) on \(n\) vertices, \(n \geq 4\), \(\pn(G) \leq \lceil n/2 \rceil\).
\begin{theorem}[Chromatic number bound\cite{bernhartBookThicknessGraph1979}]\label{thm:Colouring_Bound}
	For all graphs \(G\), \(\chi(G) \leq 2 \pn(G) + 2\).
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	Let \(\pn(G) = k\) and suppose \(G\) has \(n\) vertices and \(m\) edges. Then we have that the average degree of \(G\), \(d(G) = 2m/n\) by the handshaking lemma. But \(2m/n \leq 2 \frac{n + k(n-3)}{n} < 2k + 2\). But this implies that \(G\) has a vertex of degree \(\leq 2k + 1\), and as if \(G'\) is a subgraph of \(G\), then \(G'\) also has \(\pn(G') \leq k\), thus \(G'\) has a vertex of degree at most \(2k + 1\). However, this implies \(G\) is \(2k + 1\)-degenerate, thus \(\chi(G) \leq 2k + 2\).
\end{proof}
We may note that this bound is not tight when \(\pn(G) = 1\) or \(2\). When \(\pn(G) = 1\), then \(G\) is outerplanar, but can be coloured with 3 colours. When \(\pn(G) = 2\), then \(G\) is Hamiltonian and planar, but is 4-colourable.

\subsection{Subdivision of edges}
Let $G$ be a graph. A \textit{subdivision} of an edge $uv$ is to delete $uv$ and add a new vertex $w$ with edges $uw$ and $wv$. A graph subdivision of $G$ is to do this for all edges in $G$. A $k$-subdivision of $G$ is to subdivide each edge $k$ times in $G$.\textcite{atneosengailadeleEmbeddabilityCompactaNbooks} proved that we can subdivide a graph $G$ a finite number of times such the subdivision $G'$ has pagenumber 3. From \textcite{dujmovicLayoutsGraphSubdivisions2005}, we have that for all graphs $G$, we can subdivide $G$ with $O(\log\pn(G))$ subdivisions such that $G$ is embedded in 3 pages.

\subsection{Layouts of expander graphs}
An \textit{expander graph} is a sparse, highly connected graph. They share many properties with random graphs, but are constructed explicitly. One type of expander graph is a \textit{bipartite \varepsilon-expander}, where $\varepsilon \in (0, 1]$. We say a bipartite graph $G$ is a bipartite \varepsilon-expander if there exist a partition $ \{A, B\}$ of $V(G)$ such that $|A| = |B|$ and for all subsets $S \subset A$ where $|S| \leq \frac{|A|}{2}$, we have that $|N(S)| \geq (1 + \varepsilon) |S|$. 
\textcite{dujmovicLayoutsExpanderGraphs2016} found that all bipartite \varepsilon-expander graphs can be embedded in 3 pages. 


\subsection{History of book-embeddings}\label{ssec:Pagenumber_History}
Pagenumbers were developed for VLSI and processor designs, but more recently have been used in bioinformatics by \textcite{haslingerRNAStructuresPseudoknots1999}.
The project of finding upper and lower bounds of the pagenumber of planar graphs was started by \textcite{bernhartBookThicknessGraph1979} when they conjectured that planar graphs had unbounded pagenumber. However, \textcite{bussPagenumberPlanarGraphs1984} found that the pagenumber of planar graphs was at most 9, and \textcite{heathEmbeddingPlanarGraphs1984} found that the pagenumber of planar graphs is at most 7.\ \textcite{yannakakisEmbeddingPlanarGraphs1989} devised an algorithm to bound the pagenumber to at most 4. Yannakakis, in this paper, claimed that there exist planar graphs with pagenumber 4. However, his proof was incomplete and the full proof was left unpublished. In 2020, Yannanakis published his full proof \cite{yannakakisPlanarGraphsThat2020}. At around the same time, \textcite{kaufmannFourPagesAre2020} published a similar result.

\textcite{malitzGraphsEdgesHave1994} proved two results with the pagenumber of a graph. Malitz proved that any graph with $e$ edges has pagenumber $O(\sqrt{e})$ and that there exists $d$-regular graphs with $n$ edges that require $\Omega(\sqrt{d} N^{1/2 - 1/d})$ pages. These graphs come from random $d$-regular graphs. Therefore for random 3-regular graphs, we have that the number of pages needed is $\Omega(N^{1/6})$ pages. Finally, we have a result from \textcite{eppsteinThreeDimensionalGraphProducts2024} that $\pn(P_n \boxtimes P_n \boxtimes P_n)$ is in $\Theta(n^{1/3})$.
\section{Treewidth}\label{sec:treewidth}

The \textit{treewidth} of a graph \(G\) measures how far \(G\) is from being a forest, according to \textcite{diestelGraphMinors2017}.

\begin{definition}[Tree-decomposition]\label{def:tree-decomposition}
	The tree-decomposition \(\tree\) of a graph \(G\) is defined as a tree \(T\) with associated \textit{bags} \(\lbrace B_x : x \in V(T) \rbrace\) such that:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Every vertex in \(G\) is in at least one bag \(B_x\).
		\item for all \(v \in V(G)\), the subset of vertices \(\left\lbrace x \in V(T): v \in B_x \right\rbrace\) in \(V(T)\) induces a connected subtree in \(V(T)\).
		\item For all edges \(vw \in E(G)\), there exists a bag \(B_x\) such that both \(v\) and \(w\) are in the bag \(B_x\).
	\end{itemize}
\end{definition}
We refer to the vertices of the tree \(T\) as \textit{nodes}.
The \textit{width} of the tree decomposition \(\tree\) is defined as \(\max \lbrace |B_x| - 1 : x \in V(T) \rbrace\). An important tree-decomposition

\begin{definition}\label{def:treewidth}
	The treewidth of a graph \(G\), denoted as \(\tw(G)\), is defined to be the smallest width for all tree decompositions of the graph \(G\).
\end{definition}


\begin{lemma}\label{lem:treewidth_forest}
	\(\tw(G) = 1\) if and only if \(G\) is a forest.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	Suppose \(G\) is a tree. Root the graph \(G\) at the vertex \(r\). Then let \(T = G\) and \(B_x:= \lbrace x, p \rbrace\) where \(p\) is the parent of \(x\). The bag \(B_r\) will just contain \(r\). Then all edges \(vw\) will be between parent \(v\) and child \(w\), so it will be in bag \(B_w\). Finally, the subgraph induced by vertex \(x\) in \(T\) will be \(x\) and the children of \(x\), which is a connected subtree.
	\par
	If \(G\) is a forest, then we perform this operation on every connected component of \(G\) and connect the roots to form a new tree. Then this tree is a tree-decomposition. This forms a tree-decomposition of width at most 1. An example is in \cref{fig:tree-treedecomp}.
	\par
	If \(G\) has a cycle \(C\), then the treewidth cannot be 1. This is because if there is a tree decomposition \(\tree\) where the size of each bag is at most 2, then as the graph must have every edge, then every edge in \(C\) is in separate bags. However, we have that for any vertex \(v\) in \(C\) to have an induced connected subgraph in \(T\), then it follows that the cycle \(C\) is also in \(T\). Thus \(T\) is not a tree, and this is not a valid tree-decomposition.

		\caption{A tree and its tree-decomposition. We root at the vertex \(1\) and every bag consists of a vertex and its parent.}\label{fig:tree-treedecomp}
	\end{figure}
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}[Helly Property]\label{lem:Helly}
	Let \(T_1, \ldots, T_k\) be subtrees of a tree \(T\) such that for every pair of trees, there is a vertex in common. Then there exists a vertex which is common to all trees.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}[Helly property]
	If \(T_1\), \(T_2\) and \(T_3\) are subtrees of \(T\) such that the vertex sets are pairwise nonempty, then there is a common vertex in all three subtrees. If this is not the case, denote \(v_1\) as a vertex in the intersection of \(T_1\) and \(T_2\), \(v_2\) as the vertex in \(T_1 \cap T_3\), and \(v_3\) as the vertex in \(T_2\) and \(T_3\). Then there exists a unique path \(P\) in \(T_1\) from \(v_1\) to \(v_2\).
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}[Clique theorem]\label{thm:clique}
	In any tree-decomposition of \(G\), for every clique \(C\) in \(G\), there exists a node \(x \in V(T)\) such that \(C \subseteq B_x\).
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
	Let \(\tree\) be a tree-decomposition. Every vertex \(v\) induces a connected subtree in \(T\), call it \(T_v\). Then for any two vertices \(x, y\) in \(C\), we have that \(T_x\) and \(T_y\) must intersect as the edge \(xy\) is inside a bag \(B_z\) corresponding to a node \(z\). Then by the Helly property, there exists a node \(v\) such that \(C \subseteq B_v\).
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}\label{cor:complete_tw}
	\(\tw(K_n)\) is \(n-1\).
\end{corollary}

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:tw_minor_closure}
	If \(H\) is a minor of \(G\), then \(\tw(H) \leq \tw(G)\).
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}[Proof of theorem]
	Suppose we have a tree-decomposition \(\tree\) of \(G\). If we delete an edge in \(G\), then \(\tree\) remains a valid tree-decomposition. If we delete a vertex \(v\), then \(\tree\) where we remove \(v\) from every bag in \(\tree\) is also a valid tree-decomposition. If we contract an edge \(vw\), creating a new vertex \(u\), then relabeling \(v\) and \(w\) in all bags to \(u\) is a valid tree-decomposition as the induced subtree of \(u\) is the union of the induced subtrees of \(v\) and \(w\), and every neighbor of \(v\) or \(w\) is a neighbor of \(u\). But the edges in the neighborhood do not change. Thus this is a valid tree-decomposition of \(H\), with width at most the width of \(\tree\).
\end{proof}

Recall that an outerplanar graph is a planar graph where there exists a face such that all vertices lie on the boundary of that face.
\begin{lemma}\label{ex:tw_outerplanar}
	The treewidth of an outerplanar graph is at most 2.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	Let \(G\) be an outerplanar graph, and let \(G'\) be the triangulation of \(G\). As \(G\) is a minor of \(G'\), \(\tw(G) \leq \tw(G')\). We look at the \textit{weak dual} of \(G'\). This is a tree \(T\), where every node \(v_f\) in \(T\) corresponds to a face \(f\) in \(G'\). Then let \(B_{v_f}\) be the bag of the tree-decomposition, where \(B_{v_f}\) is the set of vertices on the boundary of the face \(f\). Then the tree \(T\) with bags \(B_{v_f}\) is a valid tree-decomposition of \(G'\), where every bag has at most 3 vertices. Thus, \(\tw(G) \leq 2\).
\end{proof}

\subsection{Characteristics of treewidth}\label{ssec:characterising_Treewidth}
\subsubsection{\(k\)-trees}\label{sssec:k-trees}
We define a \(k\)-tree inductively. We have that the complete graph \(K_k\) is a \(k\)-tree, and if \(G\) is a \(k\)-tree, then we add a new vertex to \(G\) that is adjacent to \(k\) vertices that form a clique of size \(k\) in \(G\) results in a \(k\)-tree.
A \(k\)-tree is a maximal graph with treewidth \(k\).
\begin{theorem}[K-tree theorem]
	\(\tw(G) \leq k\) if and only if \(G\) is a subgraph of a \(k\)-tree.
\end{theorem}


\subsubsection{Bounded treewidth graphs}\label{sssec:Graph_treewidth_Bounded}
\begin{theorem}\label{thm:treewidth_clique-minor-free}
	If \(\tw(G) \leq k\), then \(G\) is \(K_{k+2}\)-minor-free.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	We shall prove the contrapositive: If \(K_t\) is a minor of \(G\), then \(\tw(G) \geq t-1\).
	If \(K_t\) is a minor of \(G\), then we have that from \cref{thm:tw_minor_closure} that \(\tw(K_t) \leq \tw(G)\). As \(\tw(K_t) = t-1\), then we have that \(\tw(G) \geq t - 1\).
\end{proof}

\subsection{Historical discussion}\label{ssec:tw_historical}
Treewidth was introduced by \textcite{berteleChapterEliminationVariables1972} with applications to dynamic programming under the name ``dimension''. It was then rediscovered by \textcite{halinSfunctionsGraphs1976} before being used by \textcite{robertsonGraphMinorsIII1984}, which was introduced to prove the Graph Minor Theorem\cite{robertsonGraphMinorsXX2004}.


\section{Path-width}\label{sec:Pathwidth}
Similarly to treewidth, the pathwidth of a graph \(G\) is how far a graph is from being a path.

We define the path-decomposition of a graph \(G\) to be a sequence of bags \(B_i\) such that the subsequence of bags containing a vertex \(v\) induces a nontrivial subpath and each edge \(vw\) is in a bag \(B_i\). Then we define the width of a path-decomposition as \(\max_i \lbrace |B_i| \rbrace -1\), same as treewidth.

If a graph has a path-decomposition \({(B_i)}_i\), then it has a tree-decomposition \(\left({(B_i)}_i, P\right)\). Therefore,
\begin{equation}
	\pw(G) \geq \tw(G).
\end{equation}

Similarly to treewidth, we have the following observation.
\begin{lemma}
	The pathwidth of \(G\) is the largest pathwidth over all connected components.
\end{lemma}
We say a graph \(G\) is a \textit{caterpillar} if \(G\) has a path \(P\) and every vertex is adjacent to a vertex on the path \(P\). Alternatively, \(G\) is a caterpillar if removing every leaf yields a path. We refer to the path where every leaf is connected to as the \textit{central path}.
\begin{theorem}[Caterpillars]
	Graphs have pathwidth at most 1 if and only if every connected component is a caterpillar.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	Suppose \(G\) is a caterpillar.
	Denote \(P =\left( p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n\right)\) as the central path. The leaves of vertex \(p_i\) are denoted as \(v_{i, 1}, v_{i, 2} \dots, v_{i, k}\). Define the bags as \((v_{1, 1}, v_1)\), \((v_{1, 2}, v_1)\) \dots \((v_{1, j}, v_1)\),  \((v_1, v_2)\), \((v_{2, 1}, v_2)\), \((v_{2,2}, v_2,)\) \dots. We can see that each leaf appears once and each vertex on the central path is on a subpath of the path. Therefore, the pathwidth of \(G\) is 1. We can repeat this for every connected component.
	\par
	Suppose \(G\) has pathwidth 1. Then for each connected component of \(G\), we choose a vertex \(v\) in \(B_1\) and a vertex \(w\) in \(B_n\), the final bag, and look at a path from \(v\) to \(w\). This path must go through every bag, thus the non-path vertices must have neighbour only of the other one in the bag and thus the graph is a caterpillar. An example of this is in \cref{fig:caterpillar}.
\end{proof}
\begin{figure}[ht]
	\centering
	\includesvg{figures/caterpillar}
	\caption{A caterpillar graph. Notice that the path \(v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4, v_5, v_6\) is the central path.}
	\label{fig:caterpillar}
\end{figure}

\begin{example}[Complete graphs]
	\(\pw(K_n) = \tw(K_n) = n - 1\).
\end{example}
\begin{proof}
	We have that the pathwidth of \(K_n\) is at least the treewidth of \(K_n\). But we have that the pathwidth is at most \(n- 1\) (where all the vertices are in the same bag), but the treewidth of \(K_n\) is \(n - 1\). Therefore, \(\pw(K_n) = n - 1\).
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
	The pathwidth of a tree \(T\) is \(\min_{P \subset T} \left\lbrace 1 + \pw(T - V(P))\right\rbrace \) where \(P\) is a path.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}[Proof of pathwidth of tree]
	To show \(\pw(T) \leq 1 + \pw(T - V(P))\), we have that if \(P\) is a path in \(T\) with vertices \(v_1, v_2, \ldots v_i\), then consider the subtrees hanging off \(v_i\) for all \(i\). \(T - V(P)\) will have a path-width and we can order each connected component such that they appear in the order of the trees. Then we have that adding \(v_i\) to the bags of subtrees connected to \(v_i\), and the bag \((v_i, v_{i+1})\) between the subtrees \(v_i\) and \(v_{i + 1}\) will yield a path-decomposition of width \(1 + \pw(T - V(P))\).
	\par
	To show there exists a path \(P\) such that \(\pw(T) \geq 1 + \pw(T - V(P))\), we proceed by induction. Let \(B_1, \ldots B_n\) be a path-decomposition of \(T\). Let \(x\) live in bag \(B_1\) and \(y\) live in bag \(B_n\), the final bag. Then let \(P\) be the unique path from \(x\) to \(y\). Then \(P\) traverses through every bag in the path-decomposition. Then \(\tw(T) \geq 1 + \tw(T - P)\) by induction.
\end{proof}
